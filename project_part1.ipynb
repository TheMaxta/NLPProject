Introduction/Background\n","\n","Research project: **Comparing the Summary Generating Capabilities of Known LLMs Big and Small**\n","\n","### Objective:\n","The goal is to evaluate and compare the summary generating capabilities of various large language models (LLMs), both big and small, in terms of their effectiveness and efficiency.\n","\n","### Methodology:\n","- **Prompts Used:** For all LLMs, the prompt will be, \"Summarize the given transcript. Try to get to the underlying concepts presented in the video transcript to save the reader time and narrow down to the important takeaways.\"\n","- **LLMs to be Evaluated:** The models under scrutiny will include GPT-4 preview, GPT-3.5 turbo 16k, LLama 2, and Bard.\n","\n","### Research Purpose:\n","The research aims to:\n","- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of these billion-parameter large language models.\n","- Assess their utility in practical applications that could positively impact the world.\n","\n","### Significance:\n","Summarizing texts or video transcripts can save substantial time for students, researchers, or self-learners. This functionality, becoming increasingly common in media consumption, holds potential for significant influence in the coming years. The study will explore:\n","- The quality of summaries produced by different LLMs.\n","- Comparative effectiveness of these models.\n","- Potential utility for the general populace.\n","\n","### Potential Dangers:\n","I am also looking into this, because if these summaries are gonna be widely used in future applications, how accurate are they? As I have seen every LLM produces a different output and they each have their own quirks.\n","\n","### What I will Learn:\n","By delving into this, I can get a solid picture of what different LLM models are capable of. Then I can ask further questions like:\n","- Was it the training data that lead to this effect?\n","- Was it the model architecure that lead to some quirks in the summarization process?\n","- Why are certain models capped at smaller lengths while others can handle more?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.
