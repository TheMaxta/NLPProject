Try to get to the underlying concepts presented in the video transcript to save the reader time and narrow down to the important takeaways.\"\n","- **LLMs to be Evaluated:** The models under scrutiny will include GPT-4 preview, GPT-3.5 turbo 16k, LLama 2, and Bard.\n","\n","### Research Purpose:\n","The research aims to:\n","- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of these billion-parameter large language models.\n","- Assess their utility in practical applications that could positively impact the world.\n","\n","### Significance:\n","Summarizing texts or video transcripts can save substantial time for students, researchers, or self-learners. This functionality, becoming increasingly common in media consumption, holds potential for significant influence in the coming years. The study will explore:\n","- The quality of summaries produced by different LLMs.\n","- Comparative effectiveness of these models.\n","- Potential utility for the general populace.\n","\n","### Potential Dangers:\n","I am also looking into this, because if these summaries are gonna be widely used in future applications, how accurate are they? As I have seen every LLM produces a different output and they each have their own quirks.\n","\n","### What I will Learn:\n","By delving into this, I can get a solid picture of what different LLM models are capable of. Then I can ask further questions like:\n","- Was it the training data that lead to this effect?\n","- Was it the model architecure that lead to some quirks in the summarization process?\n","- Why are certain models capped at smaller lengths while others can handle more?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.

The primary challenge is to find the basis and dimension \n","of a given vector space spanned by four vectors. The instructor starts by explaining \n","the importance of determining a basis first because the dimension of a vector space \n","is the number of vectors in the basis. The four provided vectors may not necessarily \n","form a basis because it's not clear if they are linearly independent, an essential \n","property of a basis. To check for linear independence, the instructor suggests placing \n","the vectors as rows in a matrix and using row elimination to simplify it.
