1,"MIT Open Course on Independence, Basis, and Dimension",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeMJg4uI7o0,"""so as long as I'm introducing the idea
of a vector space I better introduce the
things that go with it the idea of its
dimension and all-important the idea of
a basis for that space that space could
be all of three-dimensional space the
space we live in in that case the
dimension is 3 but what's the meaning of
a basis a basis for three-dimensional
space or a basis for other spaces ok so
I have to explain independence basis and
dimension dimension is easy if you get
the first two ok independence and are
those vectors independent well if I draw
them in three dimensional space I can
imagine two one five going in some
direction let me draw it I was at two
one five whatever grows there that's a
one okay now is a two on the same line
if a 2 is on the same line then it would
be dependent the two vectors would be
dependent if they're on the same line
but this one is not on that line a four
to zero so it doesn't go up at all it's
it's somewhere in this plane four to
zero I'll say there whatever a two so
those are independent now where does so
they their combinations
give me a space they're combinations of
a one and A two give me a plane a flat
plane in three-dimensional space that
plane is I would say they span the plane
a one and A two span a plane
and here's the keyword span so there are
two vectors they're in three-dimensional
space and the plane they span is all
their combinations that's what we're
always doing taking all the combinations
of these vectors okay so so they're
actually a 1 and a 2 are a basis for
that plane a 1 and a 2 are a basis for
that plane because they they're
combinations fill the plane and also
they're independent I need them both if
I throw away one I would only have one
vector left and it would only span a lie
okay now let me bring in a third vector
in three dimensions well what shall I
take for that third vector huh suppose I
take a 1 plus a 2 as my third vector so
6 3 5 what about the vector 6 3 5 well
what do I know it's obviously special
it's a 1 plus a 2 it's in the same plane
so if I took a 3 equal 6 3 5 that would
be dependent if the three vectors would
be dependent with that a 3 they would
span the plane still they're
combinations would still give the plane
but they wouldn't be a basis for the
plane a 1 and a 2 and a 3 together
that's too much too many vectors for a
single plane they're vectors are
dependent and we don't a basis has to be
independent vectors you have to need
them all we don't need all three here so
that's a dependent one it is it won't go
in can't go into a basis with a 1 and a
2 because the three vectors are
dependent now let me make a different
choice so that that was dead that did
not do it all right let me take a 3
equal some other not a combination of
these but
it off in some new direction well I
don't know what that new direction is
maybe 1 0-0 what the heck I believe hope
I'm right that 1 0-0 is not a
combination here I say 1 0-0 goes off
it's pretty short there's a 3 better a 3
then that loser 6 3 5 1 0 0 is a winner
these three vectors so now a 1 a 2 and
let me add in a 3 all three of them span
a what do they span what are all the
combinations of a 1 a 2 a 3 it's 3
dimensional it's the whole 3 dimensional
space they span all of 3d the whole
3-dimensional space there a basis for
the whole 3 dimensional space they're
independent so let me you see that
picture before I move it a 1 a 2 a 3 are
independent no none of them is a
combination of the others they fill a 3
dimensional space
they're a basis for that 3 dimensional
space and that space is the hole in this
example is the hole of our 3 so let me
just write down on our next blackboards
what I mean independent independent so
independent columns of other matrix
independent columns of a matrix a means
the only solution to a V equals 0 is V
equals so if I have independent columns
then I haven't got any null space if I
have independent columns then the null
space of the matrix is just the 0 vector
is the 0
so that's this is let me write down that
example again a was the matrix 2 1 5 4 2
0 1 0 0
I believe that matrix has independent
columns so it's column space is the full
three-dimensional space its null space
only contains let me put it make that
clear that that's a vector and and and
now I'm ready to explain write down the
idea of a basis so what is a basis for
the further space a basis for I set a
space sub space independent vectors
that's the key independent vectors that
span the space the subspace whatever it
is by the way if the column space is all
of three dimensional space as it is here
that's a sub space - it's the whole
space but the whole space counts as a
sub space of itself and the 0 vector
alone counts as the smallest possible so
if we're in three dimensions the idea of
sub spaces has we have just the 0 vector
just one point that's the smallest we
have the whole 3 dimensional space
that's the biggest and then we have all
the lines through 0 those are on the
small side
we have all the planes through 0 those
are a little bit bigger so we have and
those dimensions are 0 1 2 3 the
possible
dimensions it is told to us by how many
basis vectors we need so let me look at
that and then come to dimension okay so
so independent means that the only no
combination no other combination of the
vectors no combination of these vectors
gives the zero vector except to take
zero of that zero of that and zero of
that basis so those are those are a
basis for the column space because
they're independent and their
combinations give the whole column space
okay and now I wanted to say something
about dimensions ok dimension it's a
number it's the number of basis vectors
for the subspace oh but you might say
that the subspace has other bases not
just the one you happen to think of
first and I agree many different bases
all I need for this example all I need
for the to get a basis for in this case
for three-dimensional space is I need
three independent vectors any three but
the point is the point about dimension
is that I need exactly three I can never
get two vectors that span all of our
three and I can never get four vectors
that are independent in r3 i if I have
fewer than the Bay than the dimension
number I don't have enough there they
don't span if I have too many than the
dimension they're independent there
depend
they won't they won't be independent
they can't be a basis every basis every
basis has the same number and that
number is the dimension of the subspace
alright let's just take an example just
with a picture
I'll stay in three-dimensional space but
my subspace will just be a plane so here
I'm in 3-dimensional space good now I
have my subspace is a plane so it can go
through the origin
but it's only a plane so I'm expecting
that I could take a vector in the in the
plane and I could take another vector in
the plane and they could be independent
they are they're different directions
but I couldn't find a third independent
vector in the plane every basis for the
plane so here every basis for the this
plane contains two vectors always two
and that number two is the dimension of
a plane well I'm just saying the plane
there is two-dimensional it's not the
same as r2 it's not the same that plane
is a plane in r3 it's not ordinary
two-dimensional space but it has it's
dimension is two because it takes any
vector and if I didn't like the looks of
this one
well that's no problem I mean let me go
that way that's just as good those two
vectors are independent they span the
plane they're a basis for the plane the
plane is two-dimensional that's the set
of key ideas independent span basis
basis is fundamental basis is a bunch of
vectors and dimension is how many
vectors
okay those are key ideas in linear
algebra and you'll see them come into
the big picture of linear algebra thank
you""","00:06:33>00:06:40 0 1 0 0
00:06:36>00:06:43 I believe that matrix has independent
00:06:40>00:06:46 columns so it's column space is the full
00:06:43>00:06:50 three-dimensional space its null space
00:06:46>00:06:58 only contains let me put it make that
00:06:50>00:07:03 clear that that's a vector and and and
00:06:58>00:07:07 now I'm ready to explain write down the
00:07:03>00:07:14 idea of a basis so what is a basis for
00:07:07>00:07:22 the further space a basis for I set a
00:07:14>00:07:31 space sub space independent vectors
00:07:22>00:07:43 that's the key independent vectors that
00:07:31>00:07:49 span the space the subspace whatever it
00:07:43>00:07:52 is by the way if the column space is all
00:07:49>00:07:56 of three dimensional space as it is here
00:07:52>00:07:59 that's a sub space - it's the whole

00:08:06>00:08:12 if we're in three dimensions the idea of

00:08:12>00:08:18 just one point that's the smallest we
00:08:16>00:08:20 have the whole 3 dimensional space
00:08:18>00:08:25 that's the biggest and then we have all
00:08:20>00:08:26 the lines through 0 those are on the
00:08:25>00:08:29 small side
00:08:26>00:08:31 we have all the planes through 0 those
00:08:29>00:08:36 are a little bit bigger so we have and
00:08:31>00:08:37 those dimensions are 0 1 2 3 the
00:08:36>00:08:42 possible
00:08:37>00:08:48 dimensions it is told to us by how many
00:08:42>00:08:51 basis vectors we need so let me look at
00:08:48>00:08:57 that and then come to dimension okay so
00:08:51>00:09:00 so independent means that the only no
00:08:57>00:09:02 combination no other combination of the
00:09:00>00:09:06 vectors no combination of these vectors
00:09:02>00:09:08 gives the zero vector except to take
00:09:06>00:09:12 zero of that zero of that and zero of
00:09:08>00:09:15 that basis so those are those are a
00:09:12>00:09:18 basis for the column space because
00:09:15>00:09:21 they're independent and their
00:09:18>00:09:24 combinations give the whole column space
00:09:21>00:09:31 okay and now I wanted to say something
00:09:24>00:09:40 about dimensions ok dimension it's a
00:09:31>00:09:40 number it's the number of basis vectors
00:09:46>00:09:59 for the subspace oh but you might say
00:09:55>00:10:01 that the subspace has other bases not
00:09:59>00:10:04 just the one you happen to think of

00:10:43>00:10:48 don't span if I have too many than the
00:10:46>00:10:49 dimension they're independent there
00:10:48>00:10:52 depend
00:10:49>00:10:57 they won't they won't be independent
00:10:52>00:11:00 they can't be a basis every basis every
00:10:57>00:11:07 basis has the same number and that
00:11:00>00:11:07 number is the dimension of the subspace
00:11:08>00:11:12 alright let's just take an example just
00:11:10>00:11:15 with a picture
00:11:12>00:11:19 I'll stay in three-dimensional space but
00:11:15>00:11:22 my subspace will just be a plane so here

00:11:31>00:11:36 that I could take a vector in the in the
00:11:33>00:11:38 plane and I could take another vector in

00:11:38>00:11:43 they are they're different directions

00:11:43>00:11:55 vector in the plane every basis for the
00:11:46>00:12:05 plane so here every basis for the this
00:11:55>00:12:10 plane contains two vectors always two
00:12:05>00:12:13 and that number two is the dimension of
00:12:10>00:12:16 a plane well I'm just saying the plane
00:12:13>00:12:20 there is two-dimensional it's not the
00:12:16>00:12:24 same as r2 it's not the same that plane
00:12:20>00:12:27 is a plane in r3 it's not ordinary

""","The transcript is from a teaching session focusing on the foundational concepts of vector spaces in linear algebra. The speaker begins by discussing the importance of understanding the basis of a vector space and its dimension, emphasizing independence and spanning as key factors.

Three key concepts are illustrated:

1. Independence of vectors: Vectors are independent if none of them can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. If vectors are on the same line, they are dependent; in contrast, vectors that point in different directions are independent.

2. Basis of a vector space: A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the entire space. For example, in a three-dimensional space, any two independent vectors can span a plane within that space, but a third vector is needed to span the entire three-dimensional space.

3. Dimension of a vector space: Dimension refers to the number of vectors in a basis for the space. It indicates the size of the space concerning the number of independent directions available. For instance, a plane has a dimension of two since it can be spanned by two independent vectors. A three-dimensional space requires three independent vectors to form a basis.

Additionally, the speaker introduces the concept of a matrix's null space and column space, explaining that a matrix with independent columns has a null space containing only the zero vector. The column space of such a matrix is the entire three-dimensional space it spans. In conclusion, these concepts of independence, basis, and dimension are crucial in understanding the structure of vector spaces in linear algebra.","The video introduces the concept of a vector space and explains its dimension and basis. A vector space can be three-dimensional space, and its dimension is 3. A basis for a vector space is a set of independent vectors that span the space. The video illustrates this concept by using a plane in three-dimensional space as an example. A basis for the plane consists of two independent vectors, and the dimension of the plane is 2. The video also discusses the importance of independence, span, and basis in linear algebra. Overall, the key concepts presented in the video include: vector space, dimension, basis, independence, span, and dimension.","The speaker is discussing the concept of a basis in linear algebra, specifically in the context of a three-dimensional space. They explain that a basis is a set of independent vectors that span the space, and that the number of basis vectors is equal to the dimension of the space. They also discuss the idea of a subspace, which is a smaller space that is a subset of a larger space, and explain that the dimension of a subspace is equal to the number of basis vectors needed to span it. The speaker uses examples to illustrate their points, including a plane in three-dimensional space, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the concepts of independence, span, and dimension in order to understand linear algebra.","Sure, here is a summary of the video transcript:

Key Concepts:

Vector Space: A set of vectors that can be added together and scaled by scalars.
Dimension: The number of vectors in a basis for a vector space.
Basis: A set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space.
Independent Vectors: Vectors that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of each other.
Span: The set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors.
Subspace: A subset of a vector space that is also a vector space.
Main Points:

A basis for a vector space is a set of independent vectors that span the vector space.
The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in a basis for the vector space.
Different bases for the same vector space will have the same number of vectors.
The zero vector is always dependent.
A basis for a subspace is a set of vectors that span the subspace and are independent.
The dimension of a subspace is less than or equal to the dimension of the vector space it is a subspace of.

",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMWqGD4Urso,"""hi there welcome back to recitation in
lecture you've been learning about when
vectors are
dependent when they span a space what a
basis is what a dimension of a vector
space is and the problem for today is
exactly about that we have a vector
space that is given it's spanned by
these four vectors and we're asked to
find the dimension of that vector space
and the basis for it well why don't you
hit pause on the video and work on it
for a while and I'll come back in a
little bit to help you out with it all
right we're back let's work on it well
so we need to find the dimension and the
basis remember what the dimension is
it's simply the number of vectors in a
basis for the vector space so actually
the problems is backwards we want to
find the basis for the space first and
then find the dimension all right all
right first here and second here all
right so we want to find a basis for the
vector space spanned by these four
vectors all right so you might be
tempted to just say that a basis for
this vector space is those four vectors
because they span the vector space but
there's another thing that a basis has
to satisfy and it is the elements of the
basis have to be linearly independent
and we don't know that these are so we
have to check how do we check that four
vectors are linearly independent well
there's a couple of different ways but
here's what we're going to do we're
going to put these vectors as rows of a
matrix and then we'll do elimination and
when we get to the end the rows that
have pivots are the independent ones so
let's do that
1 1 plus 2 0 minus 1 1 2 0 minus 4 1 0 1
3 2
- 3 0 - 2
all right by now you must have done
elimination a million times so I'll go a
little bit faster - its 1 0 1 0 + 2 - 4
- it's already done 1 3 minutes 3 - 2
minutes - 3 - 2 0 + 4 - 2 & 2 alright
one more step 1 1 - 2 0 - 1 I'll do done
0 1 2 1 2 0 1 minus 1 is 0 3 minus 2 is
1 - 3 + 4 is 1 2 minus 2 is 0 1 minus 1
is 0 - 2 again and 0 oh you can see
where this is going
and the next step this row is going to
disappear - 2 0 1 0 1 - 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 alright we're done with elimination
and so let's circle our pivots and here
our pivots we have three pivots and so
these 3 rows are linearly independent no
and in fact these rows still span the
same space that the initial four rows
did because when you do elimination all
that you're doing is recombining a rose
well by doing linear combinations of
them so for example your first first row
state
same throughout your second row was
replaced by Row 2 minus Row 1 but it's
really still spanning the same space and
it goes on and then the fourth row it
turns out was useless you only needed
the first three so the elements for a
basis well they will be these three so
let me write that zero one one zero
could you have used the first three rows
yes you could you can't always do that
sometimes in elimination you have to
switch rows because there's a zero where
a pivot should be when that happens you
have to use these three or you have to
keep track of which row you switched to
go back and use the initial ones but
it's really safe to use these ones and
also they're simpler than the ones that
you started with so why not the other
question that we had was what is the
dimension of the vector space well this
is the easy part
the dimension of the vector space is 1 2
3 and that solves the problem but
there's one more thing that I want to
tell you I told you that there's a
couple of ways to find out which of
those four vectors are linearly
independent and the one that I used was
I put them in two rows and perform the
elimination and picked out the rows that
have pivots on them another way to do it
is to write the initial vectors as
columns of the matrix and then perform
elimination that also works and as you
know because you're only working with
the transpose of this matrix you'll get
the same number of pivots let's go over
here where I have the same while the
transpose of that matrix I have the same
vectors but now written as columns my
four initial vector is written as
columns and here I have performed
elimination
and this is the final result let me
circle the pivots again here they are
three which is going to give me three
independent three linearly independent
vectors and hence three elements of the
basis and hence dimension three for the
vector space but I can no longer use
these three these three columns as
elements of the basis because when I did
elimination I changed the column space
so in the column space of this vectors
of this matrix is not the same as the
column space of the eliminated version
so I cannot use these in fact if you
look at them you can probably understand
that they're not going to span the same
space as these because all that I have
done here are zeros and I get a lot more
than just zeros in the last two entries
of the vectors so what I need to do is
the pivots are in the first second and
third columns I need to use these three
columns as my basis I'll just write
basis down here and that will work too
so see I have produced two different
basis for the same vector space which is
totally fine
you can pick the basis that you prefer
alright we're done thank you""","""00:00:07>00:00:12 hi there welcome back to recitation in

00:00:12>00:00:17 vectors are

00:01:04>00:01:08 basis for the vector space so actually
00:01:06>00:01:10 the problems is backwards we want to
00:01:08>00:01:12 find the basis for the space first and
00:01:10>00:01:20 then find the dimension all right all
00:01:12>00:01:21 right first here and second here all
00:01:20>00:01:23 right so we want to find a basis for the
00:01:21>00:01:25 vector space spanned by these four
00:01:23>00:01:27 vectors all right so you might be
00:01:25>00:01:29 tempted to just say that a basis for
00:01:27>00:01:32 this vector space is those four vectors
00:01:29>00:01:33 because they span the vector space but
00:01:32>00:01:36 there's another thing that a basis has
00:01:33>00:01:38 to satisfy and it is the elements of the
00:01:36>00:01:41 basis have to be linearly independent
00:01:38>00:01:44 and we don't know that these are so we
00:01:41>00:01:46 have to check how do we check that four
00:01:44>00:01:48 vectors are linearly independent well
00:01:46>00:01:51 there's a couple of different ways but
00:01:48>00:01:53 here's what we're going to do we're
00:01:51>00:01:57 going to put these vectors as rows of a
00:01:53>00:01:59 matrix and then we'll do elimination and
00:01:57>00:02:03 when we get to the end the rows that
00:01:59>00:02:05 have pivots are the independent ones so
00:02:03>00:02:16 let's do that
00:02:05>00:02:21 1 1 plus 2 0 minus 1 1 2 0 minus 4 1 0 1
00:02:16>00:02:27 3 2
00:02:21>00:02:27 - 3 0 - 2
00:02:29>00:02:34 all right by now you must have done
00:02:32>00:02:46 elimination a million times so I'll go a
00:02:34>00:02:54 little bit faster - its 1 0 1 0 + 2 - 4
00:02:46>00:03:05 - it's already done 1 3 minutes 3 - 2
00:02:54>00:03:14 minutes - 3 - 2 0 + 4 - 2 & 2 alright
00:03:05>00:03:24 one more step 1 1 - 2 0 - 1 I'll do done
00:03:14>00:03:32 0 1 2 1 2 0 1 minus 1 is 0 3 minus 2 is
00:03:24>00:03:38 1 - 3 + 4 is 1 2 minus 2 is 0 1 minus 1
00:03:32>00:03:39 is 0 - 2 again and 0 oh you can see
00:03:38>00:03:41 where this is going
00:03:39>00:03:56 and the next step this row is going to
00:03:41>00:04:01 disappear - 2 0 1 0 1 - 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 0
00:03:56>00:04:10 0 0 alright we're done with elimination
00:04:01>00:04:15 and so let's circle our pivots and here
00:04:10>00:04:19 our pivots we have three pivots and so
00:04:15>00:04:23 these 3 rows are linearly independent no
00:04:19>00:04:25 and in fact these rows still span the
00:04:23>00:04:27 same space that the initial four rows
00:04:25>00:04:30 did because when you do elimination all
00:04:27>00:04:32 that you're doing is recombining a rose
00:04:30>00:04:35 well by doing linear combinations of
00:04:32>00:04:35 them so for example your first first row
00:04:35>00:04:38 state
00:04:35>00:04:42 same throughout your second row was
00:04:38>00:04:45 replaced by Row 2 minus Row 1 but it's
00:04:42>00:04:47 really still spanning the same space and
00:04:45>00:04:49 it goes on and then the fourth row it
00:04:47>00:04:52 turns out was useless you only needed
00:04:49>00:04:57 the first three so the elements for a
00:04:52>00:05:18 basis well they will be these three so
00:04:57>00:05:18 let me write that zero one one zero
00:05:18>00:05:25 could you have used the first three rows
00:05:22>00:05:28 yes you could you can't always do that
00:05:25>00:05:30 sometimes in elimination you have to
00:05:28>00:05:32 switch rows because there's a zero where
00:05:30>00:05:34 a pivot should be when that happens you
00:05:32>00:05:36 have to use these three or you have to
00:05:34>00:05:39 keep track of which row you switched to
00:05:36>00:05:41 go back and use the initial ones but
00:05:39>00:05:43 it's really safe to use these ones and
00:05:41>00:05:46 also they're simpler than the ones that
00:05:43>00:05:48 you started with so why not the other
00:05:46>00:05:52 question that we had was what is the
00:05:48>00:05:53 dimension of the vector space well this
00:05:52>00:05:55 is the easy part
00:05:53>00:06:00 the dimension of the vector space is 1 2
00:05:55>00:06:01 3 and that solves the problem but
00:06:00>00:06:04 there's one more thing that I want to
00:06:01>00:06:07 tell you I told you that there's a
00:06:04>00:06:09 couple of ways to find out which of
00:06:07>00:06:12 those four vectors are linearly
00:06:09>00:06:14 independent and the one that I used was
00:06:12>00:06:17 I put them in two rows and perform the
00:06:14>00:06:20 elimination and picked out the rows that
00:06:17>00:06:23 have pivots on them another way to do it
00:06:20>00:06:26 is to write the initial vectors as
00:06:23>00:06:28 columns of the matrix and then perform
00:06:26>00:06:30 elimination that also works and as you
00:06:28>00:06:32 know because you're only working with
00:06:30>00:06:36 the transpose of this matrix you'll get
00:06:32>00:06:40 the same number of pivots let's go over
00:06:36>00:06:42 here where I have the same while the
00:06:40>00:06:44 transpose of that matrix I have the same
00:06:42>00:06:46 vectors but now written as columns my
00:06:44>00:06:48 four initial vector is written as
00:06:46>00:06:49 columns and here I have performed
00:06:48>00:06:52 elimination
00:06:49>00:06:56 and this is the final result let me
00:06:52>00:06:59 circle the pivots again here they are
00:06:56>00:07:01 three which is going to give me three
00:06:59>00:07:03 independent three linearly independent
00:07:01>00:07:05 vectors and hence three elements of the
00:07:03>00:07:08 basis and hence dimension three for the
00:07:05>00:07:11 vector space but I can no longer use
00:07:08>00:07:14 these three these three columns as
00:07:11>00:07:17 elements of the basis because when I did
00:07:14>00:07:19 elimination I changed the column space
00:07:17>00:07:21 so in the column space of this vectors
00:07:19>00:07:24 of this matrix is not the same as the
00:07:21>00:07:28 column space of the eliminated version
00:07:24>00:07:31 so I cannot use these in fact if you
00:07:28>00:07:33 look at them you can probably understand
00:07:31>00:07:36 that they're not going to span the same
00:07:33>00:07:38 space as these because all that I have
00:07:36>00:07:40 done here are zeros and I get a lot more
00:07:38>00:07:44 than just zeros in the last two entries
00:07:40>00:07:46 of the vectors so what I need to do is
00:07:44>00:07:52 the pivots are in the first second and
00:07:46>00:07:54 third columns I need to use these three
00:07:52>00:07:58 columns as my basis I'll just write
00:07:54>00:08:01 basis down here and that will work too
00:07:58>00:08:03 so see I have produced two different
00:08:01>00:08:04 basis for the same vector space which is
00:08:03>00:08:06 totally fine
00:08:04>00:08:10 you can pick the basis that you prefer
00:08:06>00:08:10 alright we're done thank you
""","The video is a lesson on linear algebra concepts such as vector spaces, bases, dimensions, and linear independence. The primary challenge is to find the basis and dimension of a given vector space spanned by four vectors.

The instructor starts by explaining the importance of determining a basis first because the dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in the basis. The four provided vectors may not necessarily form a basis because it's not clear if they are linearly independent, an essential property of a basis.

To check for linear independence, the instructor suggests placing the vectors as rows in a matrix and using row elimination to simplify it. Through elimination, the instructor demonstrates that only three of the vectors are linearly independent, as seen by the presence of three pivots in the resulting matrix. Consequently, the dimension of the vector space is three, and those three linearly independent vectors form a basis for the space.

Furthermore, the instructor mentions an alternative way to check for linear independence by placing the vectors as columns in a matrix, and using column elimination to find the number of pivots. However, the instructor emphasizes that after performing column elimination, one cannot use the altered columns as a basis because they change the column space.

In summary, the transcript conveys two key takeaways:
1. The dimension of a vector space is the number of linearly independent vectors in a basis for that space.
2. To find a basis, you must ensure the vectors are linearly independent; it's not sufficient for them to merely span the space. Linear independence can be assessed by row or column elimination, but basis vectors from column elimination must come from the original, non-eliminated set.","The video discusses how to find the dimension and basis of a vector space given four vectors. The first step is to determine if the vectors are linearly independent by using elimination and checking for pivots. In this case, three of the vectors are linearly independent. The three independent vectors form the basis for the vector space. The dimension of the vector space is then determined to be 3. The video also mentions that another method to find the basis is to use the transpose of the matrix with the vectors as columns. In this case, the three columns with pivots are used as the basis. It is highlighted that multiple bases can be chosen for the same vector space, allowing for personal preference.","he lecture is discussing the concept of finding a basis and dimension of a vector space. The speaker is working through a problem where they have four vectors that span a vector space and they need to find the dimension and a basis for the space.

The speaker explains that a basis is a set of vectors that span the vector space and are linearly independent. They demonstrate how to find a basis by putting the vectors as rows of a matrix and performing elimination. The rows that have pivots are the linearly independent vectors, and these form a basis for the vector space.

The speaker also mentions that there are multiple ways to find the basis, such as writing the initial vectors as columns of a matrix and performing elimination. The resulting pivots will give the linearly independent vectors that form a basis for the vector space.

The speaker then shows that the dimension of the vector space is equal to the number of pivots, which in this case is three. They also show that the basis can be chosen as the first three rows of the matrix, or the first three columns of the transposed matrix.

The speaker summarizes that the dimension of the vector space is three, and the basis can be chosen as any set of three linearly independent vectors that span the space.","Sure, here is a summary of the given transcript:

Summary:

The video discusses the concept of linear independence and how to find a basis for a vector space. The speaker first explains that a basis for a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space. Then, they demonstrate how to find a basis for a vector space using elimination. Finally, they discuss the concept of the dimension of a vector space and how it is related to the number of vectors in a basis.

Key takeaways:

A basis for a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space.
One way to find a basis for a vector space is to put the vectors as rows of a matrix and then do elimination. The rows that have pivots are the independent ones.
The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in a basis for the space.

3,"New York Times video on ‘His Name Was Bélizaire’: Rare Portrait of Enslaved Child Arrives at the Met
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n60NTrKs-wc,"""For over 100 years,
this family portrait
held a secret: a fourth figure
that had been painted out.
Now, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art
has just acquired
the painting,
one of the few 19th-century portraits
to realistically portray
an enslaved person.
Its incredible
journey to the Met
tells a story about the
erasure of Black figures
throughout American history.
And it might have
been lost forever
if not for Jeremy K. Simien.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
“My ancestors, people
of African descent,
are a part of this
United States.
And we have got to be
able to see ourself
in a historical context.
The paintings that survive
are incredibly important
because so few remain.”
Simien, an art
collector, first
stumbled across the painting
in an auction record.
The painting was unsigned.
But Jeremy thought it
looked similar to the work
of renowned portraitist
Jacques Amans.
Then, he found
another auction record
from a few years prior.
But in that image
the enslaved child
had been covered up.
“The fact that the boy was
covered up, it haunted me.
I had to find out
where he ended up.”
The story begins
with a relative
of the white children in the
painting: Eugene Grasser.
“The family story was that
there was a favorite slave
they had, and he was
painted in the picture.
And then, for whatever
reason, some time later
he was painted out.
No idea why.”
Eugene’s mother, Audrey,
inherited the portrait.
For decades she kept
it in the garage.
But in 1972 she
donated the painting
to the New Orleans
Museum of Art.
Eugene’s mother told the
museum the family’s story
about the fourth figure.
But instead of
displaying it, the museum
placed the painting in
museum storage – for 32 years.
“I think that the story
of this picture is really
a story of
institutional neglect.”
Mia L. Bagneris is a
professor of art history
and Africana studies
at Tulane University.
“This is what the work looked
like when NOMA acquired it.
And you can clearly see
the spectral outline
of the figure.”
“When it came in, it was not
in exhibitable condition.”
John Bullard started
at the museum
the year after NOMA
acquired the painting.
“And you could see the shadow.
But still, it’s not attributed
to a particular artist.
And the children
were not identified.”
“The justification that the
museum has given is that we
didn’t know who
the artist was.
We didn’t know who
the sitters were.
Those things are often
unknown for images
that feature people
of African descent
and may never be known.
And yet, the objects
themselves are still worthy
of critical scholarship.”
“There are very few museums
that can exhibit everything
they own.
One solution is to go through
and decide what might be
appropriately
de-accessioned and sold.”
In 2004, NOMA
sent the painting
to be sold at auction.
An antiques dealer bought
the painting for $6,000
and had the painting restored.
The missing figure
was revealed.
“I think, in hindsight,
it was a mistake. Yes,
but mistakes happen.”
After years of
searching, Jeremy finally
acquired the painting in
2021 and brought it back
to Louisiana.
“I didn’t realize how
important it was that I own
pieces pertaining to my
history until I realized how
bad of a job some of
these museums were doing.”
The first thing
he did was hire
Craig Crawford, a
painting conservator,
to do a second restoration.

“Hello.”
“Hey.”
“We want to get
that retouching off.
I would describe my
mission is to get
the painting as
close as one can
to the original intention.
I’m just taking off layers
that were added in the past.”
“I really wanted to find
out about the boy of color
in particular.
So, I started talking
to Katy Shannon.”
“I wanted to show
you this list.”
“She has a skill of
finding enslaved people.”
“I specialize in the people
that are seemingly lost
to history.
But I’ve never tried to go
from a painting backward.”
Katy looked back through
the Grasser family line
to try and find
someone wealthy enough
to commission the portrait.
Finally, she found someone:
Coralie D’Aunoy Frey.
Census records from
the 1830s revealed
who was living in
the Frey family home.
There was only one
possible candidate
for who the boy could be.
“And I thought, Oh my God.
He’s of mixed race.
He is the exact age.
And he was a domestic.
And I said, I found him.
His name was Bélizaire.”
“Bélizaire.”
Now that they had a name,
Katy could dig deeper,
using Louisiana property
records, which at the time
included the enslaved.
“There are 45 million
records here that date back
to the 1730s.
OK, so here it is.”
Sure enough, Katy finds
what she’s looking
for: Bélizaire’s bill of
sale at the age of 6,
which brought him into the
Frey household
in the French Quarter.
“Bélizaire was sold with
his mother, Sally, in 1828.
Frederick Frey was a merchant.
And what I found was that
Bélizaire accompanied
Frey on several voyages.
So, clearly, he was a domestic
that was close to the head
of the house and perhaps the
caretaker of the children.”
Bélizaire was
about 15 years old
when he was painted
in the portrait.
It’s a picture of domestic
tranquillity at odds with
the truth.
“Here he is seemingly valued
as if he were a family
member – and yet could be
sold away at any time.”
After Frederick Frey died,
Coralie sold Bélizaire
to Evergreen Plantation.
It was Christmas Eve, 1856.
And sometime
after he was sold,
someone had him painted out.
“It was covered up with
lighter colors to match
the skyline.”
Craig found remnants
of that skyline
in the craquelure pattern.
They became clues to
solve the mystery of when
Bélizaire was covered up.
Over time, paintings
expand and contract,
creating cracks.
“It would have taken 50 years
or so to have this level
of cracking.
The cover-up is visible within
the craquelure patterns.
That would give me the
impression that the cover-up
happened around the
turn of the century.”
“Turn-of-the-century
New Orleans –
you’re talking about a world
that had created Jim Crow
laws to separate the races
to make it very clear that
the two did not
belong together.
Whether it was Coralie or
one of her descendants,
I don’t know.”
Documents show
Bélizaire was enslaved
at Evergreen up until 1861,
the year the Civil War began.
“Did he survive and live long
enough to experience freedom?
We don’t know because
the trail stops.”
“But we know his name.
And we know about his journey.
I think that’s incredible.
My plan’s to find a
permanent home for it.
The painting has to end up
somewhere where it can be
seen.”
In the spring of 2023, a
dealer who represented Jeremy
called a curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art
to tell her about
the painting.
“I was completely drawn
and taken in by the story.
In the past, we weren’t asking
all the right questions.
We weren’t looking for
depictions of enslaved people
in a more naturalistic
way, as an actual portrait
of a person, because we
didn’t think they existed.
I’d never seen one.
They’re incredibly rare.”
The dealer included a report
with all the work Jeremy had
initiated, the
name of the artist,
Katy’s research on
Bélizaire’s life
and Craig’s
conservation report.
“That made it possible
for us to move forward.”
And so, the museum
acquired the painting
for its permanent collection
for an undisclosed sum.
“I’m afraid to say that far
too many pieces have been
de-accessioned or not
taken in by these museums.
And we’ve lost a lot as
a result of this sort
of negligence.
I can’t say how many works
there are like the painting
of Bélizaire.
But I think that everybody
should start looking
in storage.”""","""00:00:01>00:00:03 For over 100 years,

00:01:44>00:01:47 Eugene’s mother told the
museum the family’s story
00:01:47>00:01:50 about the fourth figure.
00:01:50>00:01:53 But instead of
displaying it, the museum
00:01:53>00:01:56 placed the painting in
museum storage – for 32 years.
00:02:01>00:02:04 “I think that the story
of this picture is really
00:02:04>00:02:07 a story of
institutional neglect.”
00:02:07>00:02:10 Mia L. Bagneris is a
professor of art history
00:02:10>00:02:14 and Africana studies
at Tulane University.
00:02:14>00:02:16 “This is what the work looked
like when NOMA acquired it.
00:02:16>00:02:20 And you can clearly see
the spectral outline
00:02:20>00:02:24 of the figure.”
00:02:24>00:02:28 “When it came in, it was not
in exhibitable condition.”
00:02:28>00:02:29 John Bullard started
at the museum
00:02:29>00:02:32 the year after NOMA
acquired the painting.
00:02:32>00:02:34 “And you could see the shadow.
00:02:34>00:02:37 But still, it’s not attributed
to a particular artist.
00:02:37>00:02:41 And the children
were not identified.”
00:02:41>00:02:44 “The justification that the
museum has given is that we
00:02:44>00:02:45 didn’t know who
the artist was.
00:02:45>00:02:47 We didn’t know who
the sitters were.
00:02:47>00:02:51 Those things are often
unknown for images
00:02:51>00:02:53 that feature people
of African descent
00:02:53>00:02:55 and may never be known.
00:02:55>00:02:59 And yet, the objects
themselves are still worthy
00:02:59>00:03:02 of critical scholarship.”
00:03:02>00:03:05 “There are very few museums
that can exhibit everything
00:03:05>00:03:06 they own.
00:03:06>00:03:11 One solution is to go through
and decide what might be
00:03:11>00:03:15 appropriately
de-accessioned and sold.”
00:03:15>00:03:18 In 2004, NOMA
sent the painting
00:03:18>00:03:19 to be sold at auction.
00:03:20>00:03:23 An antiques dealer bought
the painting for $6,000
00:03:23>00:03:24 and had the painting restored.
00:03:24>00:03:29 The missing figure
was revealed.
00:03:29>00:03:32 “I think, in hindsight,
it was a mistake. Yes,
00:03:32>00:03:36 but mistakes happen.”
00:03:36>00:03:39 After years of
searching, Jeremy finally
00:03:39>00:03:41 acquired the painting in
2021 and brought it back
00:03:41>00:03:42 to Louisiana.
00:03:42>00:03:45 “I didn’t realize how
important it was that I own
00:03:45>00:03:50 pieces pertaining to my
history until I realized how
00:03:50>00:03:53 bad of a job some of
these museums were doing.”
00:03:53>00:03:55 The first thing
he did was hire
00:03:55>00:03:57 Craig Crawford, a
painting conservator,
00:03:57>00:03:59 to do a second restoration.
00:03:59>00:03:59 [doorbell]
00:03:59>00:04:00 “Hello.”
00:04:00>00:04:02 “Hey.”
00:04:02>00:04:04 “We want to get
that retouching off.
00:04:04>00:04:08 I would describe my
mission is to get
00:04:08>00:04:10 the painting as
close as one can
00:04:10>00:04:12 to the original intention.
00:04:15>00:04:21 I’m just taking off layers
that were added in the past.”
00:04:21>00:04:24 “I really wanted to find
out about the boy of color
00:04:24>00:04:25 in particular.
00:04:25>00:04:29 So, I started talking
to Katy Shannon.”
00:04:29>00:04:31 “I wanted to show
you this list.”
00:04:31>00:04:35 “She has a skill of
finding enslaved people.”
00:04:35>00:04:39 “I specialize in the people
that are seemingly lost
00:04:39>00:04:40 to history.
00:04:40>00:04:45 But I’ve never tried to go
from a painting backward.”
00:04:45>00:04:48 Katy looked back through
the Grasser family line
00:04:48>00:04:50 to try and find
someone wealthy enough
00:04:50>00:04:54 to commission the portrait.
00:04:54>00:04:58 Finally, she found someone:
Coralie D’Aunoy Frey.
00:04:58>00:05:01 Census records from
the 1830s revealed
00:05:01>00:05:03 who was living in
the Frey family home.
00:05:03>00:05:05 There was only one
possible candidate
00:05:05>00:05:07 for who the boy could be.
00:05:07>00:05:08 “And I thought, Oh my God.
00:05:08>00:05:10 He’s of mixed race.
00:05:10>00:05:12 He is the exact age.
00:05:12>00:05:14 And he was a domestic.
00:05:14>00:05:17 And I said, I found him.
00:05:17>00:05:20 His name was Bélizaire.”
00:05:20>00:05:28 “Bélizaire.”
00:05:28>00:05:31 Now that they had a name,
Katy could dig deeper,
00:05:31>00:05:35 using Louisiana property
records, which at the time
00:05:35>00:05:37 included the enslaved.
00:05:37>00:05:40 “There are 45 million
records here that date back
00:05:40>00:05:43 to the 1730s.
00:05:43>00:05:45 OK, so here it is.”
00:05:45>00:05:47 Sure enough, Katy finds
what she’s looking
00:05:47>00:05:51 for: Bélizaire’s bill of
sale at the age of 6,
00:05:51>00:05:53 which brought him into the
Frey household
00:05:53>00:05:54 in the French Quarter.
00:05:55>00:06:01 “Bélizaire was sold with
his mother, Sally, in 1828.
00:06:01>00:06:03 Frederick Frey was a merchant.
00:06:03>00:06:07 And what I found was that
Bélizaire accompanied
00:06:07>00:06:10 Frey on several voyages.
00:06:10>00:06:14 So, clearly, he was a domestic
that was close to the head
00:06:14>00:06:19 of the house and perhaps the
caretaker of the children.”
00:06:19>00:06:21 Bélizaire was
about 15 years old
00:06:21>00:06:23 when he was painted
in the portrait.
00:06:23>00:06:26 It’s a picture of domestic
tranquillity at odds with
00:06:26>00:06:27 the truth.
00:06:27>00:06:31 “Here he is seemingly valued
as if he were a family
00:06:31>00:06:35 member – and yet could be
sold away at any time.”
00:06:35>00:06:38 After Frederick Frey died,
Coralie sold Bélizaire
00:06:38>00:06:40 to Evergreen Plantation.
00:06:40>00:06:45 It was Christmas Eve, 1856.
00:06:45>00:06:47 And sometime
after he was sold,
00:06:47>00:06:50 someone had him painted out.
00:06:50>00:06:53 “It was covered up with
lighter colors to match
00:06:53>00:06:54 the skyline.”
00:06:54>00:06:56 Craig found remnants
of that skyline
00:06:56>00:06:57 in the craquelure pattern.
00:06:57>00:07:00 They became clues to
solve the mystery of when
00:07:00>00:07:01 Bélizaire was covered up.
00:07:01>00:07:04 Over time, paintings
expand and contract,
00:07:04>00:07:05 creating cracks.
00:07:05>00:07:09 “It would have taken 50 years
or so to have this level
00:07:09>00:07:11 of cracking.
00:07:11>00:07:14 The cover-up is visible within
the craquelure patterns.
00:07:14>00:07:19 That would give me the
impression that the cover-up
00:07:19>00:07:23 happened around the
turn of the century.”
00:07:23>00:07:25 “Turn-of-the-century
New Orleans –
00:07:25>00:07:29 you’re talking about a world
that had created Jim Crow
00:07:29>00:07:34 laws to separate the races
to make it very clear that
00:07:34>00:07:36 the two did not
belong together.
00:07:36>00:07:40 Whether it was Coralie or
one of her descendants,
00:07:40>00:07:43 I don’t know.”
00:07:43>00:07:45 Documents show
Bélizaire was enslaved
00:07:45>00:07:49 at Evergreen up until 1861,
the year the Civil War began.
00:07:49>00:07:54 “Did he survive and live long
enough to experience freedom?
00:07:54>00:07:58 We don’t know because
the trail stops.”
00:07:58>00:08:00 “But we know his name.
00:08:00>00:08:02 And we know about his journey.
00:08:02>00:08:04 I think that’s incredible.
00:08:04>00:08:07 My plan’s to find a
permanent home for it.
00:08:07>00:08:10 The painting has to end up
somewhere where it can be
00:08:10>00:08:12 seen.”
00:08:13>00:08:16 In the spring of 2023, a
dealer who represented Jeremy
00:08:16>00:08:19 called a curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art
00:08:19>00:08:21 to tell her about
the painting.
00:08:21>00:08:25 “I was completely drawn
and taken in by the story.
00:08:25>00:08:30 In the past, we weren’t asking
all the right questions.
00:08:30>00:08:34 We weren’t looking for
depictions of enslaved people
00:08:34>00:08:38 in a more naturalistic
way, as an actual portrait
00:08:38>00:08:41 of a person, because we
didn’t think they existed.
00:08:41>00:08:43 I’d never seen one.
00:08:43>00:08:46 They’re incredibly rare.”
00:08:46>00:08:49 The dealer included a report
with all the work Jeremy had
00:08:49>00:08:51 initiated, the
name of the artist,
00:08:51>00:08:53 Katy’s research on
Bélizaire’s life
00:08:53>00:08:56 and Craig’s
conservation report.
00:08:56>00:08:59 “That made it possible
for us to move forward.”
00:08:59>00:09:01 And so, the museum
acquired the painting
00:09:01>00:09:05 for its permanent collection
for an undisclosed sum.
00:09:05>00:09:09 “I’m afraid to say that far
too many pieces have been
00:09:09>00:09:14 de-accessioned or not
taken in by these museums.
00:09:14>00:09:17 And we’ve lost a lot as
a result of this sort
00:09:17>00:09:19 of negligence.
00:09:19>00:09:23 I can’t say how many works
there are like the painting
00:09:23>00:09:24 of Bélizaire.
00:09:24>00:09:28 But I think that everybody
should start looking
00:09:28>00:09:29 in storage.”
""","The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired a 19th-century portrait that features a realistically depicted enslaved person, a rarity for its time. An art collector, Jeremy K. Simien, discovered that this painting included a figure of an enslaved boy that had been painted over. Simien was compelled to uncover the boy's identity and restore the painting to its original state. The painting's journey highlights the historical erasure of Black figures in American art.

The painting had been passed down through the Grasser family, who were told the boy was a favored slave later painted out for unknown reasons. After being inherited by Eugene Grasser's mother, the painting was donated to the New Orleans Museum of Art in 1972 but was left in storage due to its poor condition and lack of attributions. Later, it was auctioned off, restored, and revealed the figure of the enslaved boy, identified as Bélizaire. 

Researcher Katy Shannon and art conservator Craig Crawford contributed to the painting's restoration and historical investigation. Shannon traced back through the Grasser family's history to identify Bélizaire and found census and property records that shed light on his life. Bélizaire was sold to the Frey household as a child with his mother and became a domestic servant closely involved with the children and the head of the household.

Bélizaire's image was painted out around the turn of the century, a time marked by the rise of Jim Crow laws. His life after being sold to Evergreen Plantation and whether he lived to see freedom remains unknown. Simien, committed to finding a permanent home for the painting, eventually facilitated its acquisition by the Met, underscoring the importance of revisiting museum storage for neglected works that represent untold stories of Black history.","The transcript discusses the story of a family portrait that was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting had a hidden fourth figure, an enslaved person, who had been painted out. The journey of the painting highlights the erasure of Black figures throughout American history. The painting was first discovered by an art collector, Jeremy K. Simien, who was intrigued by the covered-up figure. The painting had been donated to the New Orleans Museum of Art but was placed in storage for decades due to institutional neglect. In 2004, the painting was sold at auction and the missing figure was revealed after restoration. Jeremy eventually acquired the painting and hired a conservator to restore it further. Through research, the identity of the enslaved person, named Bélizaire, was discovered, and his history as a domestic servant and caretaker of the children was revealed. The painting serves as a depiction of domestic tranquility, despite the harsh reality of enslavement. The painting was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art for its permanent collection. The story highlights the importance of recognizing and preserving artwork that features Black individuals and the need for scholars to uncover hidden histories.","The Metropolitan Museum of Art has acquired a rare 19th-century portrait of an enslaved person, which was previously unknown and had been painted out of a family portrait.

Sure, here is a summary of the given transcript:

The painting ""Bélizaire and the Frey Children"" is a rare 19th-century portrait that depicts an enslaved person, Bélizaire, alongside the three white Frey children. The painting was covered up for many years, but it was recently restored and has now been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

The story of the painting is a story of the erasure of Black figures throughout American history. For over 100 years, Bélizaire was hidden from view, and it was only through the determination of art collector Jeremy K. Simien that he was brought back to light.

Simien's journey to find the painting and uncover its history is a testament to the importance of preserving Black history. The painting is now a valuable part of the Met's collection, and it will help to tell the story of slavery in America."

",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjpnObVhKpg,"""[ Upbeat music ]
-In the open ocean you get
to pick
what countries' rules
apply to you.
And the rich and powerful
pick the countries
that conveniently
let them pay no taxes,
skip safety regulations
and screw over their crews.
We're here to break down
how the rich live above the law,
setup systems to do it
and fuck over the rest of us.
Welcome, to Offshore.
[ Upbeat music ]
Ahoy motherfuckers.
Why are wealthy people
throwing up flags
for random countries
on their damn boats?
And how does help them
get richer,
avoid rules like say,
paying your workers?
Are mega yachts mega fucked?
Or are companies
and the rich getting away
with this offshore scheming?
Okay.
Let's get into who's doing this.
The big three cruise lines
are headquartered in Miami,
but they fly flags
of offshore countries
to avoid regulations
and to save money.
Norwegian Cruises, they flay the
flag of our old friend Bermuda.
Carnival Cruises,
Carnival cruises fly's half
and half mix of Panama
and the Bahamas.
Oh.
And the Royal Caribbean Cruises
based out of the beautiful
Caribbean country of Liberia,
which is actually in Africa.
And not the Caribbean.
Don't tell me what to do,
I'm cruising baby.
Who else is doing this?
Larry Ellison,
founder of software giant
Oracle has the Cayman's flag
out for his super yacht.
Trump education secretary
Betsy DeVos's
164 foot family yacht
was registered in the Cayman's.
Despite being docked
in Huron, Ohio.
So much for America
first I guess.
Amazon founder
and want-to-be space cowboy Jeff
Bezos has a mega yacht.
That recently made news in the
Netherlands for being so large
they planned to remove
a bridge
so it could get out
to the ocean.
So does this
American billionaire,
known for exploiting
American warehouse workers,
have an American yacht?
No, of course not.
It's also registered
in the Cayman's.
So we'll talk about
how the fuck they do this,
but first why
the fuck they do this.
You skip on taxes,
safety and wages.
Not taxed in your home country,
you're just paying a little fee
in whatever country
you're setup in.
What about wages
and safety for workers?
America has labor laws,
but you don't have to worry
about those out here
on the high seas.
Your ship caught up
in a disaster, an oil spill,
well that's the business of you
and the country of whatever flag
is flapping around
the back of your boat.
So when did all this start?
After the Titanic sunk in 1912,
a worker safety
and protection law was passed.
The American Seaman's
Act of 1915.
Big boat businessmen
who were like,
we don't want to have to deal
with all these ridiculous,
unfair rules like having
food onboard for sailors,
letting them sleep,
having silly little lifeboats.
So they registered ships
in offshore countries,
open boat registries
were setup in countries
that allowed your boat
and the business of that boat
to follow the much more
chilled rules
of those far-flung countries.
As opposed to your home country.
Or the country where
the business makes its money.
That would make too much sense.
All legal, shady, but legal.
The ocean industry,
mostly cargo ships,
oil platforms and tankers
is dominated by boat
registries in Panama,
Liberia
and the Marshall Islands.
All in all,
flags of convenience
are a big part of the sea biz
and its problems.
Take the example of
the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
Remember that little incident?
It was a floating
semi-submersible drilling unit.
So, sort of a boat.
Anyway, it exploded and spilled
210 million gallons of oil,
devastating marine life
and resulting
in the worst ecological
disaster in US history.
Investigation showed a clear
lack of safety concerns.
And that was made
all the more possible
when you're flying the flag
of a country with insufficient,
unenforced regulations,
like the Marshall Islands.
Of all the industries to fly
the least regulated flags
is the oil industry.
The dirtiest, oiliest, grossest
most ecological disaster
waiting to happen.
Can we regulate one industry
that's destroying our world?
They can't be trusted.
So what about this cruise ship?
Let me tell you about
the Nordic Empress.
In 1993, the Coast Guard
caught the ship
owned by Royal Caribbean,
dumping oil in the ocean
by the Bahamas.
They eventually discover
a conspiracy to save money
on all of their boats
by dumping waste into the ocean.
Royal Caribbean denied
all this and said,
you can't come after us anyways,
because we fly
the flag of Liberia.
What the fuck is up
with the Empress?
She's Caribbean, she's Nordic,
she's really Liberian.
Who the fuck knows?
Consider me unimpressed.
Guess who else uses flags
of convenience,
the kings of the offshore.
You know them, you hate them,
the Russian oligarchs.
These fuckers.
And as you might have seen,
some of their tacky-ass
mega-yachts
are getting chased down
at ports around the world.
So, what's going on here?
Remember, Russian oligarchs
are essentially
incredibly wealthy businessmen
with extreme
political influence.
They gain monumental wealth
for the privatization
of state-run industries
after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
Now, they're also the guys
who got positions of power
because they're pals of Putin.
And they love
their giant yachts,
they're essentially
just private cruise ships.
Roman Abramovich
owns the Eclipse.
The Eclipse is the worlds
second longest private yacht.
Has two helipads
and one mini submarine.
It's worth about
half a billion dollars.
Registered in Bermuda.
Or there's Dmitry Kamenshchik
super yacht the Flying Fox.
Worth about $400 million.
Jay-Z and Beyoncé
have been to known party on.
This Russian oligarch
might have 99 problems,
but picking a flag isn't one.
He went with the Cayman Islands
for his yacht
that houses
an actual Turkish bath
and a specially designed
submarine garage.
If you have Turkish bath
on your yacht,
that's a cruise ship my man.
Why do these guys all want
a private cruise ship,
cruise ships suck,
stay on land, I don't know.
What do they want
the buffets and shit?
I wouldn't mind
owning a yacht honestly.
But now these yachts
are getting hunted down.
After the 2022
Russian invasion of Ukraine,
countries sanctioned Putin
and the oligarchs.
Remember, these guys
are basically
running the country of Putin.
The target oligarchs hid
their wealth in the offshore.
So western countries
couldn't get at it.
Russian oligarchs yachts turn
their navigation transponders
off
and sailed to ports
where they less likely
to be searched and seized.
But you can't just throw a car
cover over one of these babies.
Dilbar is a giant yacht, it was
docked for work in Germany.
Its owner was unclear
and complicated.
But EU officials
cracked the case.
It's a Russian nesting
doll game with these guys.
It was owned by a company
in the Cayman Islands
where it's registered.
But, that company's owned
by another company in Greece,
which is then owned by
another company in Switzerland.
And then it keeps going.
That's how shell company's work,
they just keep going.
Til you get a little guy, oop,
nope still not it,
still looking for
that final shell company.
Until we get, oh no,
it's even smaller,
little baby Russian oligarch.
The center is Russian oligarch,
Alisher Usmanov.
He's our little Russian doll.
Little baby oligarch.
Claims it's not his yacht,
so you can't take it,
when in reality it's owned
through several shell companies.
He's setup
for finally transferring
ownership to his sister.
He just gives something
to your sister
and pretend it's not yours,
this isn't 7th Heaven.
Where you get caught
with cigarettes
and blame it on your sister.
Despite all this
offshore concealment,
in March 2022 Germany
seized the boat.
When countries have incentive
it seems
that then all of a sudden
they can cut through
the offer of bullshit.
If you can figure out
one of the worlds largest yachts
is owned by an Russian oligarch
and its in your country's port,
then you can sell it and maybe
keep some of that money.
In Antigua and Barbuda,
they just seized a yacht,
the Alfa Nero.
Flagged in the Cayman Islands.
It seemed to be owned by
Russian oligarch Andrey Guryev.
Who denied owning it through
some shady offshore structure.
It has a lot of necessary
amenities like a swimming pool
that converts into a helipad.
Antigua and Barbuda
gave the owner ten days
to step forward
or they'd auction it off.
And no one showed up.
Well that yacht,
that's not my yacht.
Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt
bought the boat
for $67.6 million.
What a steal, practically free.
And if you think maybe
this money's going to Ukraine
or something,
well, that's very sweet of you,
but also wrong. How about this.
Sanctioned oligarch
Dmitry Pumpyansky's yacht,
the Axioma,
was seized off of Gibraltar.
The yacht ultimately
fetched $37.5 million in auction
and US investment bank JPMorgan
got the money from the sale.
The bank got $23 million back
that they previously loaned
to a billionaire Russian
oligarch for some reason.

Flags of convenience
as a scam is serious.
It's not just money,
it's the environment
and it's peoples lives too.
Like how about this.
Cargo boat owners routinely
abandoned crews on ships
at far-flung ports when
they deem repairs too costly.
Qatar-based company
called Aswan Trading
and Contracting recently
abandoned three different ships.
Some people were left at sea
for over two years
with no electricity,
no running water
and no sanitary facilities.
The company confuses authorities
that their owners are structure,
remember those
Russian nesting dolls?
And of course their ships
flew flags of convenience.
These people are miles,
thousands of miles
away from home,
getting paid
the cheapest amount,
with no safety,
no meals, no sleep
and then at the end
they're just abandoned.
Just fly them home,
just finish the job,
it's so ridiculous,
how much money do you need?
Listen, I get it,
you're trying to do business.
Just take a little bit
of responsibility,
just a small, just stop
pretending your boat
is in Panama, Liberia,
and Marshall Islands,
wherever, stop playing
make pretend.
Just take this little bit
of responsibility.
Pay your people.
Let them eat, let them sleep!
It's just this much, how much
money are you even saving?
Please, just a little bit.
Here's this last little tidbit.
Forty percent
of the oceans ships
are flagged in former
US colonies.
Setup by US businessmen
and still sold
as the state of Virginia.
So before you think this problem
is far away from me,
just know, it's as American
as apple pie.
Alright, well.
See you on the boat next week,
that was all for.
Alright, see you later.

00:00:22>00:00:27 [ Upbeat music ]
00:00:27>00:00:28 Ahoy motherfuckers.
00:00:28>00:00:30 Why are wealthy people
throwing up flags
00:00:30>00:00:32 for random countries
on their damn boats?
00:00:32>00:00:33 And how does help them
get richer,
00:00:33>00:00:36 avoid rules like say,
paying your workers?
00:00:36>00:00:37 Are mega yachts mega fucked?
00:00:37>00:00:39 Or are companies
and the rich getting away
00:00:39>00:00:41 with this offshore scheming?
00:00:41>00:00:43 Okay.
Let's get into who's doing this.
00:00:43>00:00:46 The big three cruise lines
are headquartered in Miami,
00:00:46>00:00:48 but they fly flags
of offshore countries
00:00:48>00:00:51 to avoid regulations
and to save money.
00:00:51>00:00:54 Norwegian Cruises, they flay the
flag of our old friend Bermuda.
00:00:54>00:00:58 Carnival Cruises,
Carnival cruises fly's half
00:00:58>00:01:00 and half mix of Panama
and the Bahamas.
00:01:00>00:01:03 Oh.
And the Royal Caribbean Cruises
00:01:03>00:01:06 based out of the beautiful
Caribbean country of Liberia,
00:01:06>00:01:10 which is actually in Africa.
And not the Caribbean.
00:01:10>00:01:14 Don't tell me what to do,
I'm cruising baby.
00:01:14>00:01:15 Who else is doing this?
00:01:15>00:01:17 Larry Ellison,
founder of software giant
00:01:17>00:01:21 Oracle has the Cayman's flag
out for his super yacht.
00:01:21>00:01:23 Trump education secretary
Betsy DeVos's
00:01:23>00:01:27 164 foot family yacht
was registered in the Cayman's.
00:01:27>00:01:30 Despite being docked
in Huron, Ohio.
00:01:30>00:01:32 So much for America
first I guess.
00:01:32>00:01:34 Amazon founder
and want-to-be space cowboy Jeff
00:01:34>00:01:36 Bezos has a mega yacht.
00:01:36>00:01:39 That recently made news in the
Netherlands for being so large
00:01:39>00:01:40 they planned to remove
a bridge
00:01:40>00:01:42 so it could get out
to the ocean.
00:01:42>00:01:43 So does this
American billionaire,
00:01:43>00:01:46 known for exploiting
American warehouse workers,
00:01:46>00:01:48 have an American yacht?
No, of course not.
00:01:48>00:01:50 It's also registered
in the Cayman's.
00:01:50>00:01:52 So we'll talk about
how the fuck they do this,
00:01:52>00:01:55 but first why
the fuck they do this.
00:01:55>00:01:58 You skip on taxes,
safety and wages.
00:01:58>00:02:01 Not taxed in your home country,
you're just paying a little fee
00:02:01>00:02:02 in whatever country
you're setup in.
00:02:02>00:02:04 What about wages
and safety for workers?
00:02:04>00:02:06 America has labor laws,
but you don't have to worry
00:02:06>00:02:08 about those out here
on the high seas.
00:02:08>00:02:11 Your ship caught up
in a disaster, an oil spill,
00:02:11>00:02:13 well that's the business of you
and the country of whatever flag
00:02:13>00:02:15 is flapping around
the back of your boat.
00:02:15>00:02:19 So when did all this start?
After the Titanic sunk in 1912,
00:02:19>00:02:21 a worker safety
and protection law was passed.
00:02:21>00:02:24 The American Seaman's
Act of 1915.
00:02:24>00:02:27 Big boat businessmen
who were like,
00:02:27>00:02:29 we don't want to have to deal
with all these ridiculous,
00:02:29>00:02:33 unfair rules like having
food onboard for sailors,
00:02:33>00:02:37 letting them sleep,
having silly little lifeboats.
00:02:37>00:02:40 So they registered ships
in offshore countries,
00:02:40>00:02:43 open boat registries
were setup in countries
00:02:43>00:02:45 that allowed your boat
and the business of that boat
00:02:45>00:02:47 to follow the much more
chilled rules
00:02:47>00:02:50 of those far-flung countries.
As opposed to your home country.
00:02:50>00:02:52 Or the country where
the business makes its money.
00:02:52>00:02:56 That would make too much sense.
All legal, shady, but legal.
00:02:56>00:02:58 The ocean industry,
mostly cargo ships,
00:02:58>00:03:00 oil platforms and tankers
00:03:00>00:03:03 is dominated by boat
registries in Panama,
00:03:03>00:03:05 Liberia
and the Marshall Islands.
00:03:05>00:03:06 All in all,
flags of convenience
00:03:06>00:03:09 are a big part of the sea biz
and its problems.
00:03:09>00:03:12 Take the example of
the Deepwater Horizon oil rig.
00:03:12>00:03:13 Remember that little incident?
00:03:13>00:03:16 It was a floating
semi-submersible drilling unit.
00:03:16>00:03:18 So, sort of a boat.
00:03:18>00:03:22 Anyway, it exploded and spilled
210 million gallons of oil,
00:03:22>00:03:24 devastating marine life
and resulting
00:03:24>00:03:26 in the worst ecological
disaster in US history.
00:03:26>00:03:29 Investigation showed a clear
lack of safety concerns.
00:03:29>00:03:31 And that was made
all the more possible
00:03:31>00:03:33 when you're flying the flag
of a country with insufficient,
00:03:33>00:03:36 unenforced regulations,
like the Marshall Islands.
00:03:36>00:03:40 Of all the industries to fly
the least regulated flags
00:03:40>00:03:41 is the oil industry.
00:03:41>00:03:44 The dirtiest, oiliest, grossest
most ecological disaster
00:03:44>00:03:46 waiting to happen.
Can we regulate one industry
00:03:46>00:03:48 that's destroying our world?
00:03:48>00:03:50 They can't be trusted.
So what about this cruise ship?
00:03:50>00:03:52 Let me tell you about
the Nordic Empress.
00:03:52>00:03:55 In 1993, the Coast Guard
caught the ship
00:03:55>00:03:56 owned by Royal Caribbean,
00:03:56>00:03:59 dumping oil in the ocean
by the Bahamas.
00:03:59>00:04:01 They eventually discover
a conspiracy to save money
00:04:01>00:04:04 on all of their boats
by dumping waste into the ocean.
00:04:04>00:04:06 Royal Caribbean denied
all this and said,
00:04:06>00:04:08 you can't come after us anyways,
00:04:08>00:04:11 because we fly
the flag of Liberia.
00:04:11>00:04:12 What the fuck is up
with the Empress?
00:04:12>00:04:15 She's Caribbean, she's Nordic,
she's really Liberian.
00:04:15>00:04:18 Who the fuck knows?
Consider me unimpressed.
00:04:18>00:04:20 Guess who else uses flags
of convenience,
00:04:20>00:04:22 the kings of the offshore.
00:04:22>00:04:25 You know them, you hate them,
the Russian oligarchs.
00:04:25>00:04:27 These fuckers.
And as you might have seen,
00:04:27>00:04:29 some of their tacky-ass
mega-yachts
00:04:29>00:04:31 are getting chased down
at ports around the world.
00:04:31>00:04:35 So, what's going on here?
Remember, Russian oligarchs
00:04:35>00:04:37 are essentially
incredibly wealthy businessmen
00:04:37>00:04:39 with extreme
political influence.
00:04:39>00:04:41 They gain monumental wealth
00:04:41>00:04:43 for the privatization
of state-run industries
00:04:43>00:04:45 after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
00:04:45>00:04:48 Now, they're also the guys
who got positions of power
00:04:48>00:04:49 because they're pals of Putin.
00:04:49>00:04:51 And they love
their giant yachts,
00:04:51>00:04:53 they're essentially
just private cruise ships.
00:04:53>00:04:55 Roman Abramovich
owns the Eclipse.
00:04:55>00:04:58 The Eclipse is the worlds
second longest private yacht.
00:04:58>00:05:00 Has two helipads
and one mini submarine.
00:05:00>00:05:03 It's worth about
half a billion dollars.
00:05:03>00:05:05 Registered in Bermuda.
00:05:05>00:05:08 Or there's Dmitry Kamenshchik
super yacht the Flying Fox.
00:05:08>00:05:11 Worth about $400 million.
00:05:11>00:05:13 Jay-Z and Beyoncé
have been to known party on.
00:05:13>00:05:16 This Russian oligarch
might have 99 problems,
00:05:16>00:05:18 but picking a flag isn't one.
00:05:18>00:05:21 He went with the Cayman Islands
for his yacht
00:05:21>00:05:23 that houses
an actual Turkish bath
00:05:23>00:05:26 and a specially designed
submarine garage.
00:05:26>00:05:28 If you have Turkish bath
on your yacht,
00:05:28>00:05:29 that's a cruise ship my man.
00:05:29>00:05:31 Why do these guys all want
a private cruise ship,
00:05:31>00:05:34 cruise ships suck,
stay on land, I don't know.
00:05:34>00:05:36 What do they want
the buffets and shit?
00:05:36>00:05:38 I wouldn't mind
owning a yacht honestly.
00:05:38>00:05:42 But now these yachts
are getting hunted down.
00:05:42>00:05:45 After the 2022
Russian invasion of Ukraine,
00:05:45>00:05:47 countries sanctioned Putin
and the oligarchs.
00:05:47>00:05:49 Remember, these guys
are basically
00:05:49>00:05:51 running the country of Putin.
00:05:51>00:05:53 The target oligarchs hid
their wealth in the offshore.
00:05:53>00:05:55 So western countries
couldn't get at it.
00:05:55>00:05:57 Russian oligarchs yachts turn
their navigation transponders
00:05:57>00:05:59 off
and sailed to ports
00:05:59>00:06:01 where they less likely
to be searched and seized.
00:06:01>00:06:04 But you can't just throw a car
cover over one of these babies.
00:06:04>00:06:06 Dilbar is a giant yacht, it was
docked for work in Germany.
00:06:06>00:06:10 Its owner was unclear
and complicated.
00:06:10>00:06:12 But EU officials
cracked the case.
00:06:12>00:06:14 It's a Russian nesting
doll game with these guys.
00:06:14>00:06:16 It was owned by a company
in the Cayman Islands
00:06:16>00:06:18 where it's registered.
00:06:18>00:06:23 But, that company's owned
by another company in Greece,
00:06:23>00:06:27 which is then owned by
another company in Switzerland.
00:06:27>00:06:29 And then it keeps going.
00:06:29>00:06:32 That's how shell company's work,
they just keep going.
00:06:32>00:06:34 Til you get a little guy, oop,
nope still not it,
00:06:34>00:06:37 still looking for
that final shell company.
00:06:37>00:06:39 Until we get, oh no,
00:06:39>00:06:42 it's even smaller,
little baby Russian oligarch.
00:06:42>00:06:45 The center is Russian oligarch,
Alisher Usmanov.
00:06:45>00:06:48 He's our little Russian doll.
Little baby oligarch.
00:06:48>00:06:51 Claims it's not his yacht,
so you can't take it,
00:06:51>00:06:53 when in reality it's owned
through several shell companies.
00:06:53>00:06:55 He's setup
for finally transferring
00:06:55>00:06:57 ownership to his sister.
00:06:57>00:06:59 He just gives something
to your sister
00:06:59>00:07:00 and pretend it's not yours,
this isn't 7th Heaven.
00:07:00>00:07:01 Where you get caught
with cigarettes
00:07:01>00:07:03 and blame it on your sister.
00:07:03>00:07:04 Despite all this
offshore concealment,
00:07:04>00:07:07 in March 2022 Germany
seized the boat.
00:07:07>00:07:09 When countries have incentive

00:07:09>00:07:11 that then all of a sudden
00:07:11>00:07:12 they can cut through

one of the worlds largest yachts
00:07:15>00:07:17 is owned by an Russian oligarch
and its in your country's port,
00:07:17>00:07:20 then you can sell it and maybe
keep some of that money.
00:07:20>00:07:22 In Antigua and Barbuda,
they just seized a yacht,
00:07:22>00:07:25 the Alfa Nero.
Flagged in the Cayman Islands.
00:07:25>00:07:28 It seemed to be owned by
Russian oligarch Andrey Guryev.

00:07:33>00:07:35 that converts into a helipad.
00:07:35>00:07:37 Antigua and Barbuda
gave the owner ten days
00:07:37>00:07:39 to step forward
or they'd auction it off.
00:07:39>00:07:41 And no one showed up.
00:07:41>00:07:43 Well that yacht,
that's not my yacht.

00:07:45>00:07:47 bought the boat
for $67.6 million.
00:07:47>00:07:50 What a steal, practically free.
And if you think maybe
00:07:50>00:07:52 this money's going to Ukraine
or something,

00:08:24>00:08:27 Flags of convenience
as a scam is serious.
00:08:27>00:08:28 It's not just money,
it's the environment
00:08:28>00:08:31 and it's peoples lives too.
Like how about this.
00:08:31>00:08:34 Cargo boat owners routinely
abandoned crews on ships
00:08:34>00:08:37 at far-flung ports when
they deem repairs too costly.
00:08:37>00:08:39 Qatar-based company
called Aswan Trading
00:08:39>00:08:43 and Contracting recently
abandoned three different ships.
00:08:43>00:08:45 Some people were left at sea

Russian nesting dolls?
00:08:53>00:08:56 And of course their ships
flew flags of convenience.

away from home,
00:08:59>00:09:00 getting paid
the cheapest amount,
00:09:00>00:09:02 with no safety,
no meals, no sleep
00:09:02>00:09:05 and then at the end
they're just abandoned.
00:09:05>00:09:07 Just fly them home,
just finish the job,

""","The video discusses the concept of ""flags of convenience,"" a practice in which owners of ships and yachts register their vessels in countries other than their own to benefit from more lenient regulations and lower fees. This allows wealthy individuals and corporations to avoid taxes, safety and wage regulations, and other responsibilities that they would be subjected to in their home countries. The video highlights examples where flagship cruise lines and the yachts of billionaires like Larry Ellison, Betsy DeVos, and Jeff Bezos are registered in countries such as Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands.

The history of this phenomenon dates back to after the Titanic disaster when the American Seaman's Act of 1915 was passed, which led to ship owners seeking ways to avoid strict safety regulations. This led to the creation of open boat registries in countries with lax rules.

The video also talks about the environmental and human costs associated with flags of convenience. It cites the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, where the flag of the Marshall Islands played a role in the lack of safety that contributed to the incident. Furthermore, it discusses the case of the Nordic Empress, a Royal Caribbean ship found dumping oil, which used its Liberian registration to evade the U.S. jurisdiction.

It explains how Russian oligarchs use flags of convenience along with complex ownership structures, like shell companies, to hide assets and evade sanctions, as revealed by the seizure of mega-yachts owned by Russian oligarchs following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The video also demonstrates the human cost, where cargo boat owners have abandoned crews at sea in deplorable conditions due to the cost of repairs, exploiting the flags of convenience to leave authorities confused about the ownership and responsibility of the vessels.

Finally, the video states that 40% of the world's ships are flagged in former U.S. colonies, highlighting that the problem is closely tied to American business practices and not just an international issue.

The video concludes by calling for greater corporate and individual responsibility, urging those taking advantage of flags of convenience to treat workers fairly, comply with safety regulations, and not to neglect environmental stewardship for the sake of profits.","The video discusses how the wealthy and powerful use offshore flags of convenience on their yachts and ships to avoid taxes, regulations, and responsibilities. It highlights examples of cruise lines, billionaires, and Russian oligarchs using this system. The use of flags of convenience has led to safety concerns, environmental disasters, and exploitation of workers. The video emphasizes the need for accountability and responsible behavior in the maritime industry.","The video discusses how wealthy individuals and companies use ""flags of convenience"" to avoid regulations and taxes when it comes to their luxury yachts. A ""flag of convenience"" refers to the practice of a ship flying the flag of a country other than its own in order to take advantage of lax regulations or lower taxes. The video specifically mentions the cases of Russian oligarchs and their use of offshore flags to avoid sanctions. It also discusses how some countries, like Germany, have recently seized yachts owned by Russian oligarchs in their ports in an effort to enforce sanctions.

The video also touches on the history of flags of convenience, noting that they have been used by the shipping industry for decades to avoid regulations and taxes. It highlights the case of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which involved a ship flying the flag of the Marshall Islands, a country with lax regulations. The video argues that this practice is problematic because it allows companies to avoid accountability and safety regulations, which can result in disasters like the Deepwater Horizon spill.

Overall, the video is critical of the use of flags of convenience and argues that they allow wealthy individuals and companies to avoid their responsibilities and accountabilities. It suggests that countries should take action to prevent this practice and ensure that companies and individuals are held accountable for their actions.","The video talks about how wealthy people use flags of convenience to avoid taxes and regulations. It also discusses how this can lead to environmental damage and exploitation of workers.

Flags of convenience are flags that are flown by ships that are registered in countries other than the country where the ship is owned or operated. This is often done to avoid taxes and regulations in the home country.

The video gives the example of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, which was registered in the Marshall Islands. The rig exploded in 2010, causing the worst oil spill in US history. The Marshall Islands has very lax regulations on oil rigs, and this may have contributed to the disaster.

The video also discusses how flags of convenience can be used to exploit workers. For example, cargo ship owners have been known to abandon crews on ships at far-flung ports when they deem repairs too costly. The Aswan Trading and Contracting company, for example, recently abandoned three different ships. Some of the crew members were left at sea for over two years with no electricity, running water, or sanitary facilities.

The video concludes by calling on wealthy people to take responsibility for their actions and to stop using flags of convenience. It also calls on governments to crack down on the use of flags of convenience."
5,"Channel: 'Top LuxuryTop 10' on Biggest Megaprojects in Europe
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSD_dAwl8Dg,"""From the largest offshore wind farm the world has
ever seen, to a deeply controversial canal that
threatens the political stability in the Black
Sea. These are the top 10 megaprojects in Europe.
This video is sponsored by
Squarespace. More on that later.
We start off with
Number 10: The Stad Ship Tunnel - $272M
Over in the rocky coasts of Norway lies
a patch of sea feared by many sailors.
Considered as the convergence of the North Sea
and the Norwegian Sea, the Stadhavet Sea is one
of the busiest maritime routes in the country.
Historically, the area has been known to be one
of the most dangerous waters along the coast with
unpredictable winds and weather conditions. It
has been documented by historians that even the
Vikings would choose to drag their boats across
land instead of sailing through these waters.
Today, the Stadhavet Sea is still widely
regarded as a treacherous area for even
the most experienced sailors. In fact,
most ships today usually wait for days until the
waters have calmed and safe passage is possible.
To make traversing this area safer, the Norwegian
Coastal Administration drafted plans to create
what would become the world’s first full-size
ship tunnel. The Stad Ship Tunnel would completely
bypass the dangerous Stadhavet Sea and cut
right through the Stad Peninsula, reducing
travel times by up to two hours. The tunnel
will be 1.8 kilometers long, 50 meters wide,
and 36 meters high. It will be able to accommodate
as much as 120 ships each day. Once completed,
the Stad Ship Tunnel will be the first of its
kind in the world allowing for the passage of
full-size oil tankers and cruise ships.
In 2021, the project got approval from
the Norwegian government with a budget of more
than 272 million USD. Construction on the Stad
Ship Tunnel is expected to begin some time in
2024 and is estimated to be completed by 2026.
Number 9: Frankfurt International
Airport Expansion Project - $5.7B
Frankfurt International Airport is by far
Germany's largest and busiest international
airport serving as much as 70 million passengers
each year. As well as being the busiest passenger
airport in the country, Frankfurt International is
also Europe’s busiest cargo hub handling more than
2 million tons of shipments just last year alone.
Because of its importance as a major European
transport hub, and the ever-growing number
of passengers each year, a $5.7 billion
expansion project was initiated back in 2005 to
improve the airport’s facilities and increase
the airport's passenger and cargo capacity.
One of these projects was the expansion of
the airport’s oldest terminal that extended the
structure’s length by 800 meters allowing for a
total of seven new wide-body aircraft stands.
This expansion alone increased the airport’s
capacity by more than six million passengers
each year when it was completed in 2012.
Another project that drastically changed the
airport’s layout was the creation of a new
2.8-kilometer runway in 2011 that ran from east to
west. With this new runway, simultaneous landings
were now possible which significantly increased
the amount of aircrafts the airport could handle.
Finally in 2015, construction on a brand new
third terminal in a plot of land south of the
runways began. The area used to be the site of a
US airbase, but was reclaimed by the airport when
the base closed down in 2005. The new terminal
3 is expected to increase the airport’s capacity
by as much as 19 million passengers annually
and cost more than $1.1 billion to construct.
Because of delays brought by the COVID-19
pandemic, the new terminal is now
expected to open some time in 2026.
Number 8: Istanbul Canal - $10-15B
Situated at the crossroads between Europe and
Asia, the city of Istanbul in Turkey is located
at one of the most strategic locations in the
world. The city itself is built on either side
of the critical Bosphorus Strait that connects the
Black Sea to the Mediterranean and to the rest of
the world’s oceans. This natural waterway
on its own sees more ships pass through it
compared to the Panama and Suez canals combined.
However, despite being completely within Turkish
borders, Turkey actually doesn’t benefit from
the strait financially. This is because of an
international treaty that Turkey signed back
in 1936 called the Montreux Convention that
regulates its use. The agreement ensured Turkey’s
neutrality during WW2 by heavily restricting the
access of warships in the strait, and it also
guaranteed free access to all civilian vessels.
As one of the world’s busiest shipping routes,
the strait is oftentimes congested to the point
wherein ships usually have to wait days
just to pass through it. To minimize this
shipping traffic, the Turkish government is
planning to construct the Istanbul Canal. An
artificial waterway that would cut right
through the European side of Istanbul,
effectively turning it into an island.
The new canal would be 45 kilometers long
and is estimated to cost the Turkish government
as much as $15 billion. It began construction in
2021 and is expected to take seven years to
complete. This new waterway would completely
bypass the Bosphorus, and some experts even
argue, the Montreux Convention itself. With this,
Turkish allies such as the United States could in
theory be given access to the Black Sea and send
warships just outside of Russia’s borders.
Turkey would also be able to charge vessels
that pass through it hoping for the project
to pay for itself over the next few years.
Number 7: Hornsea 3 & 4 - $19.2B
As you probably already noticed, we
are using an amazing 3D size comparison animation
for this video. Our partners from \""To the Top\""
helped us with this. If you want to see more
videos like this, be sure to subscribe to their
channel! But now we continue with Hornsea 3 & 4.
When it comes to offshore wind power, the United
Kingdom is the second largest producer
in the world only behind China. In fact,
4 out of the 5 largest offshore wind farms in the
entire world are all located within the country.
Most notable of the four are the Hornsea Projects
One and Two wind farms which are both the second
and first largest in the world respectively.
Hornsea 1 and 2 are both located in the North
Sea 80 kilometers east off the English coast.
Together, these two wind farms generate a total
of 2.6GW of power, enough to serve as much as 3
million UK homes. The wind farm will also take
up an area of 870 square kilometers which is
roughly half the area of the city of London.
However, despite the immense scale of the
country’s offshore wind farms amounting to
as much as 14GW of total generation, they
are still a long way from their goal of
reaching a combined capacity of 50 GW by 2030.
Because of this, newer and bigger offshore wind
farms are currently being planned to be built
in the country. Hornsea 3 is one of these
wind farms currently under construction and is
expected to be finished by 2027. The project is
planned to be built east of Hornsea 1 over an
area of 700 square kilometers. Once complete,
Hornsea 3 is expected to generate 2.8 GW of
power through 230 individual wind turbines.
Even more power than Hornsea 1 and 2 combined.
Finally, Hornsea 4 is currently in its planning
stage and will cover an area of 600 square
kilometers northwest of Hornsea 1. The project
is expected to start construction in 2023
and aims to be operational by the year 2027.
Number 6: Energy Islands of Denmark - $30B
Continuing with the topic of offshore wind farms,
Denmark is no stranger when it comes to the
technology. The world’s first ever offshore
wind farm was actually built in the country way
back in 1991 and served as a catalyst for the
further development of the technology. Today, wind
power accounts for almost half of Denmark’s energy
production; the highest percentage in the world.
As part of their goal to further develop its
sources of clean and renewable energy, the
Danish government is planning to undergo the
largest construction project in the entire
country’s history. By 2030 Denmark aims to
build the world’s first ever Energy Islands;
which will connect massive offshore wind
farms to Denmark and neighboring countries.
Denmark’s Energy Islands will consist of two
large-scale offshore wind farms located in the
North and Baltic Seas. An artificial island will
be created in the North Sea section to act as
a central hub for the area and once completed,
would have a total capacity of up to 10GW,
enough to serve 10 million European households.
The island of Bornholm in the Baltic will serve
as the second hub and have a capacity of 3GW.
Once completed, the Energy Islands would
increase Denmark’s wind energy capacity
by as much as sevenfold. Construction on the
project is expected to begin as early as 2024.
Number 5: European route E39 - $30.6B
Because of Norway’s coastal geography
being extremely rocky, mountainous, and separated
by thousands of tiny islands, it has always been
difficult to navigate. The European route E39
tries to solve this very problem by providing an
easy to traverse path along the Norwegian coast.
But even with the E39 in place, the 1,300 km long
route still does not solve the problem
of creating a continuous path along the
entire Norwegian coast. This is because the
E39, despite being designated as a single
highway that goes all the way from Denmark up
to the middle of Norway, is actually composed
of many different sections across vast stretches
of water. Driving through the entire route would
require travelers to board seven different ferry
connections and would take at least an entire day.
However, this is all about to change as the
Norwegian government is planning to cut the
20+ hours of travel time in half. They plan
to achieve this by completely eliminating all
the required ferry connections. This will be
done through a series of tunnels and bridges
that would bypass the water crossings along the
route. Essentially creating a continuous path from
Aalborg in Denmark, up to Trondheim in Norway.
One vital part of this upgrade to the E39 is
the Rogfast Subsea Tunnel which would connect
the city of Stavanger and Bokn in Norway under
a 15-kilometer stretch of water. If completed,
the tunnel would become the world’s longest and
deepest road tunnel with a length of 27 km
and a depth of almost 400 meters below the
surface. Work on the tunnel began back in 2018
and it is currently expected to open in 2033.
The project also calls for the creation of
four individual floating highways that would
carry the E39 across some of Norway’s
largest, and most breathtaking fjords.
One of these planned bridges would go over the
Bjørnafjorden and span a total of five kilometers
above the water. Once completed, this floating
bridge would become the longest in the world;
more than doubling the current record.
Number 4: Grand Paris Express - $38B
The Paris Metro is one of the busiest metro
systems in the entire world, seeing as much as 4
million passengers each day. It is also known for
its iconic entrances all built in the early 1900s
in the Art Nouveau architectural style. Being
one of the most visited cities in the world,
Paris suffers from the worst traffic congestions
in Europe. To combat this worsening problem,
it has been a top priority for the city
government to build infrastructure that would
facilitate the millions of commuters
that pass through Paris every day.
One major project that is aimed to combat Paris’
worsening traffic is the Grand Paris Express. The
largest transport project in the city which aims
to further increase the reach and connectivity
of the already intricate Paris Metro. The project
calls for the creation of four entirely new lines
and the extension of two existing ones. In
total, the Grand Paris Express is expected
to create 200 km of new tracks along with 68
new stations capable of serving an additional 2
million passengers daily. Construction of the new
lines began back in 2015 and is currently being
constructed in phases up to the year 2030.

Now, let's continue with
Number 3: Hinkley Point C
Nuclear Power Station - $47B
Nuclear power plants are notoriously
known to be both very expensive to build,
and extremely costly to decommission. However, if
managed properly, their benefits can far outweigh
their initial costs. So when the Hinkley Point
C Nuclear Power Station in the United Kingdom
was first proposed in 2010 it was met with
mixed opinions from the British people. But
with substantial financial backing from both
French and British energy companies, everything
was looking quite well for the new plant.
Hinkley Point C is part of a new generation of
nuclear power plants that are meant to replace the
country’s old, costly, and inefficient plants. The
project was initially slated to complete in the
early 2020s and have a total capacity of 3.2GW,
enough to supply 7% of the entire country’s
energy needs. However, the construction was
unfortunately met with multiple delays that pushed
its completion date by 8 years and saw its cost
balloon to more than double of initial estimates.
For one, one of Hinkley Point C’s financial
backers withdrew from the project back in 2013
amidst rising construction costs caused by
the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The COVID-19
pandemic further exacerbated the already
delayed project with supply chain complications
and cutting down on people working on the site.
Today, the project is still under construction and
is now estimated to cost as much as $47 billion,
more than twice of its initial price
tag with the completion date being
pushed back to as far as 2028.
Number 2: High Speed 2 - $132B
When the high-speed train connection between
London and the Channel Tunnel opened in 2007,
it was met with huge success.
Constructed on time and under budget,
High Speed 1 managed to significantly reduce
the travel time between London and Paris.
Because of its unprecedented success, the British
government looked to create a second high-speed
line that would connect the British capital to
major city centers to its north. So in 2009,
the Department for Transportation started to
draw up plans for a second high-speed train
line which would aptly be called High Speed 2.
High Speed 2’s construction will be done in two
phases: one going from London to Birmingham,
and another from Birmingham to Manchester and
the East Midlands Parkway. As of 2020, the
estimated budget for the entire project is
known to go for as much as $132B and will
become the biggest transport investment
program in the country in over a century.
Construction work on the new high-speed line
started back in 2020 with the creation of viaducts
and tunnels that would carry the line over and
under different terrain. The project is estimated
to be completed some time in the early 2030s.
Number 1: Trans-European Transport Network - $625B
The European Union is known for its vast and
interconnected web of roads, railways, and
airports that make it extremely easy for people to
go in and out of different countries. In fact, 27
European countries are all part of what is called
the Schengen Area. Travel between countries within
this area is largely free of border controls
and functions as a single jurisdiction
all covered under a single visa policy.
As part of an effort to further connect the
European nations and make travel easier,
the EU drafted plans to create what is
essentially an all encompassing transport
network across the entire continent. The
Trans-European Transport Network is a
long-term project that will consist of roads,
railways, airports, seaports, waterways, and
telecommunications infrastructure that would
solidify the EU as a single interconnected
entity. The entire project will be divided into
nine different sections called core network
corridors that would cover all major population
centers across Europe. The entire project is
estimated to cost as much as $625B and
is envisioned to be completed by 2050.
One notable part of this ambitious vision
is the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel that will connect
the German island of Fehmarn to Lolland in
Denmark. The project started back in 2021
and once completed in 2029, it would become the
world’s longest road and rail tunnel. This vital
piece of infrastructure would drastically
reduce the travel time between the Danish
capital of Copenhagen to the German city of
Hamburg and the rest of continental Europe.
Another interesting part of the project
is the Mont Cenis Base Tunnel which will
cross the Alps and connect Italy and
France through high-speed rail. It
is part of the greater Lyon-Turin rail link
project meant to bring together both country’s
rail networks for easier trade and travel. At
a length of 58 kilometers, the Mont Cenis Base
Tunnel is set to become the world’s longest rail
tunnel once it is completed some time in 2030.

00:01:22>00:01:27 full-size oil tankers and cruise ships.
In 2021, the project got approval from
00:01:27>00:01:34 the Norwegian government with a budget of more
than 272 million USD. Construction on the Stad
00:01:34>00:01:41 Ship Tunnel is expected to begin some time in
2024 and is estimated to be completed by 2026.
00:01:42>00:01:47 Number 9: Frankfurt International
Airport Expansion Project - $5.7B
00:01:49>00:01:53 Frankfurt International Airport is by far
Germany's largest and busiest international
00:01:53>00:01:59 airport serving as much as 70 million passengers
each year. As well as being the busiest passenger
00:01:59>00:02:05 airport in the country, Frankfurt International is
also Europe’s busiest cargo hub handling more than
00:02:05>00:02:11 2 million tons of shipments just last year alone.
Because of its importance as a major European
00:02:11>00:02:17 transport hub, and the ever-growing number
of passengers each year, a $5.7 billion
00:02:17>00:02:23 expansion project was initiated back in 2005 to

pandemic, the new terminal is now
00:03:30>00:03:37 expected to open some time in 2026.
Number 8: Istanbul Canal - $10-15B
00:03:39>00:03:45 Situated at the crossroads between Europe and

00:04:06>00:04:11 borders, Turkey actually doesn’t benefit from
the strait financially. This is because of an
00:04:11>00:04:15 international treaty that Turkey signed back
in 1936 called the Montreux Convention that
00:04:15>00:04:21 regulates its use. The agreement ensured Turkey’s
neutrality during WW2 by heavily restricting the
00:04:21>00:04:26 access of warships in the strait, and it also
guaranteed free access to all civilian vessels.
00:04:26>00:04:32 As one of the world’s busiest shipping routes,
the strait is oftentimes congested to the point
00:04:32>00:04:36 wherein ships usually have to wait days
just to pass through it. To minimize this
00:04:36>00:04:41 shipping traffic, the Turkish government is
planning to construct the Istanbul Canal. An
00:04:41>00:04:45 artificial waterway that would cut right
through the European side of Istanbul,
00:04:45>00:04:50 effectively turning it into an island.
The new canal would be 45 kilometers long
00:04:50>00:04:56 and is estimated to cost the Turkish government
as much as $15 billion. It began construction in
00:04:56>00:05:02 2021 and is expected to take seven years to
complete. This new waterway would completely
00:05:02>00:05:08 bypass the Bosphorus, and some experts even
argue, the Montreux Convention itself. With this,
00:05:08>00:05:13 Turkish allies such as the United States could in
theory be given access to the Black Sea and send
00:05:13>00:05:18 warships just outside of Russia’s borders.
Turkey would also be able to charge vessels
00:05:18>00:05:22 that pass through it hoping for the project
to pay for itself over the next few years.
00:05:22>00:05:30 Number 7: Hornsea 3 & 4 - $19.2B
As you probably already noticed, we
00:05:30>00:05:36 are using an amazing 3D size comparison animation
for this video. Our partners from \""To the Top\""
00:05:36>00:05:41 helped us with this. If you want to see more
videos like this, be sure to subscribe to their
00:05:41>00:05:47 channel! But now we continue with Hornsea 3 & 4.
When it comes to offshore wind power, the United
00:05:47>00:05:52 Kingdom is the second largest producer
in the world only behind China. In fact,
00:05:52>00:05:57 4 out of the 5 largest offshore wind farms in the
entire world are all located within the country.
00:05:57>00:06:03 Most notable of the four are the Hornsea Projects
One and Two wind farms which are both the second
00:06:03>00:06:08 and first largest in the world respectively.
Hornsea 1 and 2 are both located in the North
00:06:08>00:06:14 Sea 80 kilometers east off the English coast.
Together, these two wind farms generate a total
00:06:14>00:06:21 of 2.6GW of power, enough to serve as much as 3
million UK homes. The wind farm will also take
00:06:21>00:06:27 up an area of 870 square kilometers which is
roughly half the area of the city of London.
00:06:27>00:06:32 However, despite the immense scale of the
country’s offshore wind farms amounting to
00:06:32>00:06:37 as much as 14GW of total generation, they
are still a long way from their goal of
00:06:37>00:06:43 reaching a combined capacity of 50 GW by 2030.
Because of this, newer and bigger offshore wind
00:06:43>00:06:48 farms are currently being planned to be built
in the country. Hornsea 3 is one of these
00:06:48>00:06:54 wind farms currently under construction and is
expected to be finished by 2027. The project is
00:06:54>00:07:00 planned to be built east of Hornsea 1 over an
area of 700 square kilometers. Once complete,
00:07:00>00:07:06 Hornsea 3 is expected to generate 2.8 GW of
power through 230 individual wind turbines.
00:07:06>00:07:13 Even more power than Hornsea 1 and 2 combined.
Finally, Hornsea 4 is currently in its planning
00:07:13>00:07:19 stage and will cover an area of 600 square
kilometers northwest of Hornsea 1. The project
00:07:19>00:07:26 is expected to start construction in 2023
and aims to be operational by the year 2027.
00:07:26>00:07:33 Number 6: Energy Islands of Denmark - $30B
Continuing with the topic of offshore wind farms,
00:07:33>00:07:38 Denmark is no stranger when it comes to the
technology. The world’s first ever offshore
00:07:38>00:07:44 wind farm was actually built in the country way
back in 1991 and served as a catalyst for the
00:07:44>00:07:50 further development of the technology. Today, wind
power accounts for almost half of Denmark’s energy
00:07:50>00:07:55 production; the highest percentage in the world.
As part of their goal to further develop its
00:07:55>00:08:00 sources of clean and renewable energy, the
Danish government is planning to undergo the
00:08:00>00:08:05 largest construction project in the entire
country’s history. By 2030 Denmark aims to
00:08:05>00:08:10 build the world’s first ever Energy Islands;
which will connect massive offshore wind
00:08:10>00:08:15 farms to Denmark and neighboring countries.
Denmark’s Energy Islands will consist of two
00:08:15>00:08:21 large-scale offshore wind farms located in the
North and Baltic Seas. An artificial island will
00:08:21>00:08:26 be created in the North Sea section to act as
a central hub for the area and once completed,
00:08:26>00:08:31 would have a total capacity of up to 10GW,
enough to serve 10 million European households.
00:08:31>00:08:38 The island of Bornholm in the Baltic will serve
as the second hub and have a capacity of 3GW.
00:08:38>00:08:43 Once completed, the Energy Islands would
increase Denmark’s wind energy capacity
00:08:43>00:08:49 by as much as sevenfold. Construction on the
project is expected to begin as early as 2024.
00:08:50>00:08:57 Number 5: European route E39 - $30.6B
Because of Norway’s coastal geography
00:08:57>00:09:03 being extremely rocky, mountainous, and separated
by thousands of tiny islands, it has always been
00:09:03>00:09:09 difficult to navigate. The European route E39
tries to solve this very problem by providing an
00:09:09>00:09:16 easy to traverse path along the Norwegian coast.
But even with the E39 in place, the 1,300 km long
00:09:16>00:09:20 route still does not solve the problem
of creating a continuous path along the
00:09:20>00:09:26 entire Norwegian coast. This is because the
E39, despite being designated as a single
00:09:26>00:09:28 highway that goes all the way from Denmark up
to the middle of Norway, is actually composed
00:09:28>00:09:33 of many different sections across vast stretches
of water. Driving through the entire route would
00:09:33>00:09:39 require travelers to board seven different ferry
connections and would take at least an entire day.
00:09:39>00:09:44 However, this is all about to change as the
Norwegian government is planning to cut the
00:09:44>00:09:50 20+ hours of travel time in half. They plan
to achieve this by completely eliminating all
00:09:50>00:09:54 the required ferry connections. This will be
done through a series of tunnels and bridges
00:09:54>00:09:59 that would bypass the water crossings along the
route. Essentially creating a continuous path from
00:09:59>00:10:02 Aalborg in Denmark, up to Trondheim in Norway.
One vital part of this upgrade to the E39 is
00:10:02>00:10:08 the Rogfast Subsea Tunnel which would connect
the city of Stavanger and Bokn in Norway under
00:10:08>00:10:13 a 15-kilometer stretch of water. If completed,
the tunnel would become the world’s longest and
00:10:13>00:10:19 deepest road tunnel with a length of 27 km
and a depth of almost 400 meters below the
00:10:19>00:10:26 surface. Work on the tunnel began back in 2018
and it is currently expected to open in 2033.
00:10:26>00:10:31 The project also calls for the creation of
four individual floating highways that would
00:10:31>00:10:36 carry the E39 across some of Norway’s
largest, and most breathtaking fjords.
00:10:36>00:10:41 One of these planned bridges would go over the
Bjørnafjorden and span a total of five kilometers
00:10:41>00:10:45 above the water. Once completed, this floating
bridge would become the longest in the world;
00:10:45>00:10:52 more than doubling the current record.
Number 4: Grand Paris Express - $38B
00:10:53>00:10:59 The Paris Metro is one of the busiest metro
systems in the entire world, seeing as much as 4
00:10:59>00:11:00 million passengers each day. It is also known for
its iconic entrances all built in the early 1900s
00:11:00>00:11:03 in the Art Nouveau architectural style. Being
one of the most visited cities in the world,
00:11:03>00:11:08 Paris suffers from the worst traffic congestions
in Europe. To combat this worsening problem,
00:11:08>00:11:12 it has been a top priority for the city
government to build infrastructure that would
00:11:12>00:11:16 facilitate the millions of commuters
that pass through Paris every day.
00:11:16>00:11:22 One major project that is aimed to combat Paris’
worsening traffic is the Grand Paris Express. The
00:11:22>00:11:27 largest transport project in the city which aims
to further increase the reach and connectivity
00:11:27>00:11:32 of the already intricate Paris Metro. The project
calls for the creation of four entirely new lines
00:11:32>00:11:38 and the extension of two existing ones. In
total, the Grand Paris Express is expected
00:11:38>00:11:44 to create 200 km of new tracks along with 68
new stations capable of serving an additional 2
00:11:44>00:11:50 million passengers daily. Construction of the new
lines began back in 2015 and is currently being
00:11:50>00:11:55 constructed in phases up to the year 2030.

00:12:54>00:12:56 Now, let's continue with
00:12:56>00:13:00 Number 3: Hinkley Point C
Nuclear Power Station - $47B
00:13:01>00:13:06 Nuclear power plants are notoriously
known to be both very expensive to build,
00:13:06>00:13:12 and extremely costly to decommission. However, if
managed properly, their benefits can far outweigh
00:13:12>00:13:16 their initial costs. So when the Hinkley Point
C Nuclear Power Station in the United Kingdom
00:13:16>00:13:22 was first proposed in 2010 it was met with
mixed opinions from the British people. But
00:13:22>00:13:26 with substantial financial backing from both
French and British energy companies, everything
00:13:26>00:13:31 was looking quite well for the new plant.
Hinkley Point C is part of a new generation of
00:13:31>00:13:37 nuclear power plants that are meant to replace the
country’s old, costly, and inefficient plants. The
00:13:37>00:13:43 project was initially slated to complete in the
early 2020s and have a total capacity of 3.2GW,
00:13:43>00:13:49 enough to supply 7% of the entire country’s
energy needs. However, the construction was
00:13:49>00:13:55 unfortunately met with multiple delays that pushed
its completion date by 8 years and saw its cost
00:13:55>00:14:00 balloon to more than double of initial estimates.
For one, one of Hinkley Point C’s financial
00:14:00>00:14:06 backers withdrew from the project back in 2013
amidst rising construction costs caused by
00:14:06>00:14:12 the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The COVID-19
pandemic further exacerbated the already
00:14:12>00:14:17 delayed project with supply chain complications
and cutting down on people working on the site.
00:14:17>00:14:24 Today, the project is still under construction and
is now estimated to cost as much as $47 billion,
00:14:24>00:14:27 more than twice of its initial price
tag with the completion date being
00:14:27>00:14:34 pushed back to as far as 2028.
Number 2: High Speed 2 - $132B
00:14:35>00:14:40 When the high-speed train connection between
London and the Channel Tunnel opened in 2007,
00:14:40>00:14:45 it was met with huge success.
Constructed on time and under budget,
00:14:45>00:14:49 High Speed 1 managed to significantly reduce
the travel time between London and Paris.
00:14:49>00:14:54 Because of its unprecedented success, the British
government looked to create a second high-speed
00:14:54>00:15:00 line that would connect the British capital to
major city centers to its north. So in 2009,
00:15:00>00:15:05 the Department for Transportation started to
draw up plans for a second high-speed train
00:15:05>00:15:10 line which would aptly be called High Speed 2.
High Speed 2’s construction will be done in two
00:15:10>00:15:15 phases: one going from London to Birmingham,
and another from Birmingham to Manchester and
00:15:15>00:15:20 the East Midlands Parkway. As of 2020, the
estimated budget for the entire project is
00:15:20>00:15:26 known to go for as much as $132B and will
become the biggest transport investment
00:15:26>00:15:31 program in the country in over a century.
Construction work on the new high-speed line
00:15:31>00:15:36 started back in 2020 with the creation of viaducts
and tunnels that would carry the line over and
00:15:36>00:15:42 under different terrain. The project is estimated
to be completed some time in the early 2030s.
00:15:43>00:15:52 Number 1: Trans-European Transport Network - $625B
The European Union is known for its vast and
00:15:52>00:15:57 interconnected web of roads, railways, and
airports that make it extremely easy for people to
00:15:57>00:16:04 go in and out of different countries. In fact, 27
European countries are all part of what is called
00:16:04>00:16:09 the Schengen Area. Travel between countries within
this area is largely free of border controls
00:16:09>00:16:13 and functions as a single jurisdiction
all covered under a single visa policy.
00:16:13>00:16:18 As part of an effort to further connect the
European nations and make travel easier,
00:16:18>00:16:23 the EU drafted plans to create what is
essentially an all encompassing transport
00:16:23>00:16:28 network across the entire continent. The
Trans-European Transport Network is a
00:16:28>00:16:33 long-term project that will consist of roads,
railways, airports, seaports, waterways, and
00:16:33>00:16:38 telecommunications infrastructure that would
solidify the EU as a single interconnected
00:16:38>00:16:43 entity. The entire project will be divided into
nine different sections called core network
00:16:43>00:16:49 corridors that would cover all major population
centers across Europe. The entire project is
00:16:49>00:16:56 estimated to cost as much as $625B and
is envisioned to be completed by 2050.
00:16:56>00:17:01 One notable part of this ambitious vision
is the Fehmarn Belt Tunnel that will connect
00:17:01>00:17:06 the German island of Fehmarn to Lolland in
Denmark. The project started back in 2021
00:17:06>00:17:12 and once completed in 2029, it would become the
world’s longest road and rail tunnel. This vital
00:17:12>00:17:16 piece of infrastructure would drastically
reduce the travel time between the Danish
00:17:16>00:17:21 capital of Copenhagen to the German city of
Hamburg and the rest of continental Europe.
00:17:22>00:17:26 Another interesting part of the project
is the Mont Cenis Base Tunnel which will
00:17:26>00:17:30 cross the Alps and connect Italy and
France through high-speed rail. It
00:17:30>00:17:31 is part of the greater Lyon-Turin rail link
project meant to bring together both country’s
00:17:31>00:17:37 rail networks for easier trade and travel. At
a length of 58 kilometers, the Mont Cenis Base
00:17:37>00:17:42 Tunnel is set to become the world’s longest rail
tunnel once it is completed some time in 2030.
00:17:43>00:17:48 Which of these projects are you most excited
